I"J<p>We saw kajal off, the dust settled, then later that night I pondered.. <br />
For our story to begin, when is the kickoff, I wondered</p>

<p>Days went by, my phone was irritated with my constant vigil and follow..<br />
It was gut wrenching to see the notification light still being hollow</p>

<p>May be she didn’t like me, maybe she isn’t single, I haven’t figured out all..<br />
Forget about meet ups, there wasn’t even a missed call</p>

<p>When you blame yourself it is a new low..<br />
No end in sight even after 2 years of being solo</p>

<p>I doubted myself, my abilities, my USP..<br />
Simple person I am, not a prodigy</p>

<p>I called them out wondering if they were still around, my qualities..<br />
Photography, humor and singing, all crawled out, there were no anomalies</p>

<p>I like independent girls and always let them be..<br />
I never exercise control nor question, being a companion is my style not frivolity</p>

<p>I have been in 2 long term relationships, and they made me stronger..<br />
Current loneliness was a choice, not result of the somber</p>

<p>What went wrong, why even start if for such end, the questions linger.. <br />
I liked you, really did, I’m just venting out, not pointing finger</p>

<p>When expectations are high and lot of desire..<br />
I told myself, this is what happens when you play with fire</p>

<p>Unlike your past, I want to be a lifer..<br />
Past will be forgotten like a bad dream, with no need to decipher</p>

<p>Maybe it was far fetched, with you being the Princess and me the pauper..<br />
At our age, the least I expected was a thing called closure</p>

<p>The poem was long with lot of negativity..<br />
It is because of my disappointment not the lack of creativity</p>

<p>Tornado of joy went through my path..<br />
It left nothing but destruction, this is my aftermath</p>
