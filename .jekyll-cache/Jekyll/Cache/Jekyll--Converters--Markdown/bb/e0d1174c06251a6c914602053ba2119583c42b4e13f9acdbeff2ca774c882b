I"·<p>Blades of morning grass<br />
swayed in fresh breeze<br />
The dew drops, the stream,<br />
the garden, the trees</p>

<p>â€œDeepakâ€, words rung<br />
they broke my reverie<br />
Awake or asleep this instant?<br />
a condition, so weary</p>

<p>Sharp out of daze<br />
it was your smile <br />
Just your presence<br />
enough to drift awhile</p>

<p>You moved with abandon<br />
the skirtâ€™s twist &amp; turn<br />
Elegance personified<br />
my quest to discern</p>

<p>You stopped and stared<br />
piercing deep brown eyes<br />
Intoxicating, the charm<br />
hypnotic, frozen, effusive tries</p>

<p>Your being inspires poetry<br />
fervent, beauty divine<br />
Lips to embarrass a rose<br />
the moan to still even time</p>

<p>Close as touch,<br />
yet unreachable, a crest<br />
Each tick, a lifetime<br />
an indefinite test</p>

<p>Such beauty, the urge<br />
to whisk you off your feet<br />
Or swoon over your elegance<br />
on my knees, entreat</p>

<p>Unbounded love<br />
winged but not yet wild<br />
Only smiles &amp; glances<br />
akin a helpless child</p>

<p>Yhe agony, the confusion<br />
punishment and bethrow<br />
â€˜I deserveâ€™, an illusion<br />
soul pleads, forgive &amp; forgo</p>

<p>Elusive, this rapture <br />
embrace the flow<br />
For once, my love<br />
just let go</p>

<p>Epilogue:<br />
â€œBeauty in eyes of beholderâ€, <br />
she said in kind<br />
With smile and a shake, I told her<br />
â€œThe world is blindâ€</p>
