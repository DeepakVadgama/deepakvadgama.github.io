I"<p>Yours is not to judge and opine every moment’s behest..  <br />
Yours is to experience only love and be oblivious to the rest</p>

<p>Yours is not to react to flattery nor provocations..<br />
Yours is to be a beam of love, unswerving for all creations</p>

<p>Yours is it not to climb this material world; that’s not the quest..<br />
Yours is to dwell within; harmonious, soul and God abreast</p>

<p>Yours is not to struggle in this quicksand of world’s chaos..<br />
Yours is to sidestep; steadfast towards quietude and solace</p>

<p>Yours is not to expect spontaneous grant of all spiritual wisdom.. <br />
Yours is to build faith, and let the soul emerge with its insight</p>

<p>Yours is not to find rationale on the surface, only to return dimmer.. <br />
Yours is to find a level deeper and let your heart simmer</p>

<p>Yours is not to force matters of heart’s flutter..<br />
Yours is to be lost, deep in Her eyes, let longing suffer</p>

<p>Yours is not to do..<br />
Yours is to be</p>

<p>Love.</p>
