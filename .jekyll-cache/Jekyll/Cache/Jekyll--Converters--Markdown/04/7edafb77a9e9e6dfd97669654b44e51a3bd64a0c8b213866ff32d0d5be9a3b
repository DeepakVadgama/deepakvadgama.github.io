I"<p>Undercurrent of pain surfaces too often, for all years I wasted failing to acknowledge you..<br />
O Divine Mother, do forgive me, for it must have been equally painful for you too</p>

<p>This phase of life feels all so strange; from detachment trudging towards admiration..<br />
Ours is an upstream flow compared to this material worldâ€™s every relation</p>

<p>I did not know any better, knowledge was blinded by this bodyâ€™s constant calls to indulge.. <br />
Like when natural rhythm of time takes over and memory cells refuse to divulge</p>

<p>Though it wasnâ€™t precinct, knowledge came hastily, rushed, not in pieces one after another..<br />
Reaching middle age, my actions are still understated, the unexpressed love for my Mother</p>

<p>I hope the progression is relentless, and I jump past the spiritual teenage years.. <br />
With no stage of taking you for granted, Iâ€™d rather be a child with many irrational fears</p>

<p>Crying a river for your attention, screaming for you not being in my sight..<br />
This is probably the â€˜surrenderâ€™ veds claim, a way to bliss and eternal delight</p>

<p>I am sure you will arrive, for I will be clocking in years of languish..<br />
A Mother cannot sustain a blind eye towards Her son in such anguish</p>

<p>I am sure you will place my head in your lap and caress my hair..<br />
Your presence would be enough, yet blissful will be your tenderness and care</p>

<p>The wheels of progression, prayed upon, will keep turning, until I settle on true love..<br />
My heart will finally grasp its core nature, which is not to expect, but just to love</p>

<p>A token of this love will be wrapped, presented to you by each tear rolling down my faceâ€¦<br />
The only way I know to call out to my Mother; O Divine Mother, I wait intently for your grace</p>
