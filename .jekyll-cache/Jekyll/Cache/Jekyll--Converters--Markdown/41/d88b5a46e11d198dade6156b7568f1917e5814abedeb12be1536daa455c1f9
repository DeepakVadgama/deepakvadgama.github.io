<p>If someone asked me how much I earn; Iâ€™d say, less than I deserve but more than I needâ€¦  <br />
At the end of the day, all that I should want is shelter, clothing and cute little piglets to feed</p>

<p>Itâ€™s weird that most of us, including me, are infected with the virus of greedâ€¦<br />
Shouldnâ€™t we all strive for content, make it not our motto but also our creed?</p>

<p>Oh you HR managers, stop grinning; the logic is not without girthâ€¦  <br />
Money is still the universal measuring tape for valuing a candidateâ€™s worth</p>

<p>Unlike convention, salary negotiations donâ€™t call for aggressionâ€¦  <br />
An ideal world would instead strive towards correct tools for valuation</p>

<p>Some earn by trading sweat for it, few by being on a winning spreeâ€¦<br />
Others in exchange for their services, and the rest by charging a flat fee</p>

<p>How can something made of paper be so authoritative, you might enquireâ€¦  <br />
Itâ€™s not the paper being exchanged, rather itâ€™s value, decided by seller and the buyer</p>

<p>Many ask the same question repeatedly; these souls cannot be dismissed outrightâ€¦<br />
The formula for its valuation has been tampered with and they are entitled to fight</p>

<p>â€˜50% percent of global wealth belongs to 1% of populationâ€™, statistic shrieksâ€¦<br />
Hats off if itâ€™s all earned by capitalism, if not, foul allege the meeks</p>

<p>Historians project simpler times, exchange of items with barter system in placeâ€¦<br />
Assigning value to those items was unnerving, resulting arguments lacked all grace</p>

<p>How easy it is when money dictates value, the acceptance began at turn of last centuryâ€¦<br />
Until man-made monsters like credit crisis surfaced, and the world erupted with fury</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not wise enough to advice you, but I sure can pretend itâ€¦<br />
Let me share my 2 cents with you; yes, pun intended</p>

<p>Get a necklace or tickets to Europe, or anything your spouse always secretly yearnedâ€¦<br />
Euphoric she will feel, thus you will too, like the wedding vows being reaffirmed</p>

<p>Take your family to maldives; those white-sand beaches, the coral reefs; its like heaven on earthâ€¦<br />
Resulting memories will be cherished till eternity; ignore the bills, memories are completely worth</p>

<p>Donâ€™t tremble about the cost of education, be proud to know that your child dreams of MITâ€¦<br />
Even without fancy university, a successful entrepreneur one day, she still might be</p>

<p>Whatever you do, assign value to every single penny in your vaultâ€¦<br />
Otherwise the heap will keep decaying, eventually wonâ€™t be worth its salt</p>

<p>Use similar formula to judge people, but not just based on whose wallet is fatterâ€¦<br />
Results vary wildly with empathy and commitment; these characteristics do matter</p>

<p>If God gave us a prism for right behavior about money, it will display a broad spectrumâ€¦<br />
From Larry Page pushing the humanity forward, to an enlightened sage doling out words of wisdom</p>

<p>I go out everyday, to learn, to contribute, to get more skillful and snappyâ€¦<br />
I exchange it for money, but guess which side of the transaction makes me more happy</p>

<p>Once you invest in experiences and not materials, it all becomes clear as dayâ€¦<br />
May we realize that money is just one of the values, clear-headed ones always pray</p>

<p>This poemâ€™s disconnect from previous ones is weird, even downright funnyâ€¦  <br />
At worst, it wasted your time, but thank God this blog doesnâ€™t charge any money</p>
