I"
<p>Sometimes matters of heart start with ecstasy and end in agony… <br />
World makes no sense amidst the chaos, until you have an epiphany</p>

<p>I woke up, eyes dazed, utterly confused…<br />
Something was different, for a few seconds I remained unmoved</p>

<p>With birds chirping, the day seemed so bright…<br />
Unlike last 2 weeks, my chest didn’t feel so tight</p>

<p>I danced and sang the tunes of my choice…<br />
The day was liberating, I finally found my voice</p>

<p>I found myself in a mirror, uninhibited, unchained…<br />
With long lost dimpled smile, welcome back Deepak, I exclaimed</p>

<p>May be it’s not about vindication, it’s about self discovery…<br />
Like someone long lost on an island, to have gazed upon a ferry</p>

<p>I even talked to my deserted friend, my current nickname for her is prego..<br />
Our friendship just keeps adding up, akin to the blocks of Lego</p>

<p>For most, happiness is about getting drunk and acting wild…<br />
For me, it’s being oblivious to the pain like a giggling child</p>

<p>So far I have come in last few weeks, it is beyond belief…<br />
Here I thought when the worst is over, all you feel is just relief</p>

<p>Leap ahead, push the boundaries, I screamed…<br />
Scale the walls of success, your heroics will be beamed</p>

<p>Like a thunderbolt erupting from dark clouds, I will emerge… <br />
This phase of life will be remembered, as my surge</p>

<p>@Gaya<br />
You bring calm and logic wherever you go, be it a fun party or a situation dire…<br />
Rare are people like you; I want you to be with me if the world is ever on fire</p>

<p>@Mau<br />
Absorb every bit of the closeness with friends before you embark on a wonderful journey of marriage…<br />
For the beautiful, talented and joyful person you are, you deserve being treated like a royal, including the carriage</p>

<p>@Poem-inspirer<br />
If things go south, don’t be afraid, there is always a dawn…<br />
Reach out to me, there is still a page left in the book for our swan-song</p>
