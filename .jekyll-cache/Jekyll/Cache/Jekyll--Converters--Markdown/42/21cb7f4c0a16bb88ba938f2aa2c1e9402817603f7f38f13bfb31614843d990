I"k<p>Those gorgeous eyes like the earth’s green..<br />
and those straight hair, you looked like a queen</p>

<p>The chubby cheeks and the dimpled smile..<br />
Then why wouldn’t getting ready take a while</p>

<p>It was crowded, awful lot of people..<br />
Yet you stood out, like water, it was clear and simple</p>

<p>Everyone likes you, its no surprise..<br />
Full of joy you are, like an angel in guise</p>

<p>Lights danced and the music soared..<br />
I am glad everyone on the floor went overboard</p>

<p>We boogied while inhibitions went lower..<br />
then someone requested the music to go slower</p>

<p>Left alone by gaya &amp; mau, you were cornered..<br />
It was sweet, we made it work, hope it wasn’t awkward</p>

<p>My sis was being married, the moments were tough..<br />
me, my family and our tearful snuff</p>

<p>Amidst all tears, yours was a smile..<br />
encouraging my sister to be happy every mile</p>

<p>My relatives harassed you, without a cause..<br />
accept my deepest apologies, in good fun it was</p>

<p>They shed all seriousness and played it like a game..<br />
oh that alkesh, hetal and sandhya-ben</p>

<p>The joke was stretched, the odds were few..<br />
We could be a good team I hoped, I wished, I just knew</p>

<p>With time running out, I floundered, I hassled..<br />
So much to say, tons to know, albeit, our meets castled</p>

<p>You turned me down though the goodbye was playful..<br />
I think you were being considerate, for that I’m grateful</p>

<p>Blink-of-an-eye came the end to all of this..<br />
am I forced to think of it as just two days of bliss?</p>

<p>Forgetting the moments will be amiss..<br />
there will be times, when we all will reminisce</p>

<p>May be it’s wrong, maybe it’s not fair.. <br />
Give it a chance, unless you don’t care</p>

<p>I don’t ask for much, neither promise you any..<br />
If nothing else, people will call us chummy</p>

<p>If rivers are experiences, with our closed ones in tow..<br />
Then these memories are the energetic underflow</p>

<p>I digress, I overthink, when the thoughts flow..<br />
Its 1 am, my dreams are calling, got to go</p>
