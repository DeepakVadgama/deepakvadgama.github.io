I"<p>Fear of closed spaces or of heights..<br />
Or of insects and darkness of the nights</p>

<p>Fear of a bad grade or a red mark in school..<br />
Or of speaking your mind and being proven a fool</p>

<p>Fear of being a deserter and pressing abort..<br />
Or the fear of cheating and getting caught</p>

<p>Fear of mischiefs and mom’s scolding.. <br />
Or of death and God’s eventual accounting</p>

<p>Fear of the proposal and whether she will disprove..<br />
Or of the parents who still might not approve</p>

<p>Fear of not being liked by your children; or an estranged wife..<br />
Or of not realizing your true potential, pondered over at far end of life</p>

<p>Fear of giving it all and yet ending up all alone..<br />
Or of being outcasted, with no one to even hear your moan</p>

<p>Fear can turn into either joy or sadness, and sometimes into relief.. <br />
Awaiting it’s fate, it is inevitable, to dislodge your own belief</p>

<p>We never share our fear with closed ones, a conclusion quite logical..<br />
Curled up alone in the darkness, you wonder if getting away is even possible</p>

<p>It’s like seeing a ghost, during an otherwise peaceful night.. <br />
When you can’t outrun it, let alone putting up a fight</p>

<p>Fear grows with age; gets uglier even if it remains cloaked.. <br />
It dies naturally if ignored; becomes a monster if ever stoked</p>

<p>Fear can scare you into thinking the worst is yet to come.. <br />
Though it keeps you grounded, alive and most of all, a human</p>

<p>I wonder if realization of fear is worse or if fear in itself, more affront.. <br />
Is hope uplifting or is it better dealing with a problem known upfront</p>

<p>So answer me sweet friend, unless you want to keep it due.. <br />
Do you control your fear or does it control you?</p>
