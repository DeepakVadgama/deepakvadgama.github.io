<p>‘protect your queen’ the soldiers screamed amidst chaos..<br />
the colosseum was engulfed by dust and murderers seeking payoff</p>

<p>the ground quenched its thirst.. none spared, neither women nor daughters<br />
merciless, faceless, men.. a ruthlessly executed slaughter</p>

<p>surrounded, the queen stood still.. today, the fate would be sealed<br />
her choices flashed against the sun.. while soldiers kept her concealed</p>

<p>she felt responsible, and cursed herself for soldiers’ plight..<br />
one last breath, she closed her eyes; this was no longer a winning fight</p>

<p>when oppression takes control and end of an angel is nigh..  <br />
courage and loyalty rise from the ashes.. fearless, ready to die</p>

<p>it spread the wings across the field..<br />
their enormity formed her only shield</p>

<p>he flew, he swung as fiercely as he roared..<br />
the moment froze, as even his growl soared</p>

<p>he engulfed the sun and announced his presence<br />
once disgruntled, believed to be long lost..<br />
it breathed venom and fire to protect the mother  <br />
she must be saved at any cost.. at any cost</p>

<p>Drogon suffers as the spears are hurled<br />
against all odds, the queen rushes to protect her child..<br />
she climbs on his back; the whisper of ‘fly’<br />
and he soars towards the sky with triumphant roar so wild</p>
