I"m<p>Often, I wonder<br />
If there can be love without tears</p>

<p>Tears not of pain.. but<br />
Of pure joy<br />
Of your heart giving in<br />
Of ego accepting defeat<br />
Of soul declaring surrender</p>

<p>Often, I wonder<br />
If the literature of love is real</p>

<p>Unconditional.. demanding<br />
Of only attention<br />
Of no special qualities<br />
Of no hard earned knowledge<br />
Of no right of passage</p>

<p>Often, I wonder<br />
If intensity of love can be measured</p>

<p>Naive interactions..<br />
Of hand holding<br />
Of infectious smiles<br />
Of innocent questions<br />
Of call outs for the beloved</p>

<p>Often, I wonder<br />
If everyone experiences love</p>

<p>Of being lost in its purity<br />
Of a feeling overwhelming<br />
Of dim realization in hindsight<br />
Of an experience allowed to partake</p>

<p>Often, I wonder<br />
If such love can be repaid</p>

<p>There isn’t enough..<br />
Of material value to match<br />
Of love in my tiny heart<br />
Of gratitude to go around<br />
Of authority over you, to work around</p>

<p>Often, I wonder<br />
If she isn’t you, yourself, Radhe</p>
