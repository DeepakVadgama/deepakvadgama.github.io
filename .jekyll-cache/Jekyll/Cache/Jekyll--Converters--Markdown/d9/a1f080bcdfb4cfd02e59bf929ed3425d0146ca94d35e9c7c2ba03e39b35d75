I"ö<p>first blush, provoked a blank stare<br />
the devil grinned, muttered â€˜bewareâ€™</p>

<p>mirage it must, in this world of shadow<br />
defiant breeze, invigorating meadow</p>

<p>your eyes, they bedim the stars<br />
your smile, could stop the wars</p>

<p>your hair, to bewilder a stream<br />
your voice, to startle a dream</p>

<p>your grace, to seduce the red<br />
your physique, to rouse the dead</p>

<p>description, inconceivable verbal<br />
an angel, ageless immortal</p>

<p>any resistance, futile and fraught<br />
against manifestation of â€˜smoking hotâ€™</p>

<p>even your wraith, quelled the thirst<br />
it rose again, your aura, the lust</p>

<p>provocative, such charge and fire<br />
a queen, impervious to extrinsic desire</p>

<p>oblivious to own power, fluttering unaware<br />
sole hope for meeks, elude the spell, go dare</p>

<p>urge to overpower, to touch and kiss<br />
angst of sullying, your soft pink lips</p>

<p>brush of my fingers, across your waist<br />
I pull you closer, getting a taste</p>

<p>the hold and kiss, ascension and zest<br />
the charge electric, does not accord protest</p>

<p>unruly the tension, possessed, I accede<br />
fire engulfs, then you concede</p>

<p>the struggle retracts, your lips part<br />
you loosen the grip, bodies no longer apart</p>

<p>pleading â€˜yesâ€™, you accept defeat<br />
intertwined, start &amp; end, no longer discrete</p>

<p>rhythmic movement, I hear your moan<br />
let alone mortals, it would stir a stone</p>

<p>euphoric the end, broken with a smile<br />
moment of ecstasy, devoid of guile</p>

<p>nectar of Gods, girl of dreams<br />
itâ€™d force a slob, become man of means</p>

<p>blinded by self, misgave premonition<br />
Iâ€™m now a fanatic, you my addiction</p>

<p>nobody knows you like I do, thank the lord<br />
Itâ€™d cause an uproar, battle of the gods</p>

<p>epilogue:<br />
your presence, triggers dilation<br />
your proximity, spurs exhilaration<br />
your touch, reveals liberation<br />
your absence, breeds sedation</p>
