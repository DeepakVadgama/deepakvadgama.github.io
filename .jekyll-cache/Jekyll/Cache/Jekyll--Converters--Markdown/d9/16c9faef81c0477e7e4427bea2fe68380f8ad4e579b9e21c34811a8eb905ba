I"º<p>A fuzz ball cute and cuddly..<br />
Always cheerful and bubbly</p>

<p>Running around ungated..<br />
Spreading love unabated</p>

<p>Your nature confounds me..<br />
Enthralls me, stirs me</p>

<p>Pulling in the weary..<br />
By hand, if necessary</p>

<p>To play and have fun abound..<br />
For me undeserved, unfound</p>

<p>Infinite supply of love, acceptance..<br />
Universal need, fueling sustenance</p>

<p>Spotted a many, alone, engaged, content..<br />
Rarity even amongst adults in ascent</p>

<p>Tender age of 2 compels astound..<br />
Iâ€™m sparse to turn the puzzle around</p>

<p>Motherâ€™s love blinds the queer..<br />
Strangers witness, day-light theatre</p>

<p>Curly hair and round face..<br />
Reminisce, Krishna and His Grace</p>

<p>Parts equal, innocent and naughty..<br />
Akin, Radha and Her Grace</p>

<p>I thank Her, affection, unconditional..<br />
Vessels change, love remains</p>

<p>Yours truly..<br />
Uncle Uncle</p>
