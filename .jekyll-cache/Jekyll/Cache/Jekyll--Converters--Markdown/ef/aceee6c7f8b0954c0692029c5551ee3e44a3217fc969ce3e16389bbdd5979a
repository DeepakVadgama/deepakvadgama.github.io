I"<p>does he live in the beauty of this nature..<br />
or does he live in earth’s every creature</p>

<p>does he live in statues and temples..<br />
or does he live in photos and memorials</p>

<p>does he live in each and everyone of us.. <br />
or does he live outside, engulfing the universe</p>

<p>did he create this universe, the earth and it’s creatures..<br />
or did he create the laws of physics and let it run its course</p>

<p>did he create only one earth and one universe..<br />
or did he create infinite versions of everyone of us</p>

<p>did he create us post thousands of other species..<br />
or we are souls as eternal as himself just altering bodies</p>

<p>did he program us with a beautiful and vastly complex algorithm..<br />
or has he given us free will and sparked evolution’s natural rhythm</p>

<p>can he predict our behavior..<br />
or does he want to change our motives, ulterior</p>

<p>does he account for all of our deeds..<br />
or does he forgive like a parent when the child pleads</p>

<p>is he happy with the world &amp; where its headed..<br />
or having seen atrocities over generations, is he all jaded</p>

<p>does he like to be liked by all us..<br />
or is he beyond needs of the mortals like us</p>

<p>does he want us to be his friend..<br />
or does he want us to be his children</p>

<p>does he want us to be connected to each other..<br />
or does he want us to connect to him and no other</p>

<p>does he greet us warmly when we eventually perish..<br />
or does he quip, I’d given you decades worth to cherish</p>

<p>is he always around, omnipresent divine..<br />
or has he left our world and its been a long time</p>

<p>we’ve made up our minds on few while searching answers for many..<br />
the real question to ask is, are we even worthy of any</p>
