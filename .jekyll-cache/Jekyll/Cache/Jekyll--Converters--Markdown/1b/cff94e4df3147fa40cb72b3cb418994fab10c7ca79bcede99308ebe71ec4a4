<p>Let us introduce ourselves, but I want to be discreet..<br />
If anyone can guess who we are, they are in for a treat</p>

<p>Like rivers, we are, intertwining along the way..<br />
Come wind or storm, we are difficult to sway</p>

<p>First one flows uninhibited cutting through foliage, second is a smooth flowing stream..<br />
third deludes to being straight as a canal, the last being white water extreme</p>

<p>Vulnerable we feel sometimes, and may be also lack of might.. <br />
But supergirls we are together, we won’t go down without a fight</p>

<p>How lucky we are; it was pure coincidence that we came together..<br />
Until we start believing in fate, in that case, we were meant to be with each other</p>

<p>Reminisce the stay at mau’s, oh the gossip, the laughter and the sharing..<br />
Forgive all the cuss words, the underlying theme has always been of caring</p>

<p>So sisters, lets skip away, lets laugh in the face of time’s dying pulse..<br />
We love to spend time with each other; its not logic, its impulse</p>

<p>Pure joy we experienced for so long, with no need for pennies nor a dime.. <br />
Then why does time feel so fleeting, may be this is Einstein’s relativity of time</p>

<p>World doesn’t see our closeness, they think we are scattered over a mile..<br />
Come to think of it, the joke is on them, because stealth is our style</p>

<p>Let’s party with shots, vodka or a few beers..<br />
It’s us against the world; we are the 4 musketeers</p>

<p>Let’s get wild, lets paint the town red, like they say ‘rage against the dying light’.. <br />
Lets eat and drink like theres no tomorrow; to compensate, there is always oats and egg-white</p>

<p>A sage told me to give up the one, and instead make the world my muse..<br />
But my poems are nothing but stories that rhyme, and the creative circuit in me mandates that fuse</p>

<p>So I am slowly expanding from the one, to you four.. <br />
Its sad that I don’t know you girls a bit more</p>

<p>This poem is still rough at the edges; I’m going to keep it that way..  <br />
Inspite of what philosophers say, words don’t always obey</p>

<p>It will never be the same again, things coming to a close, we better believe it.. <br />
Oh wait, we are and will always be, our friendship is a circle, we will always re-live it</p>

<p>So raise your glasses for this moment, soak it, one last time.. <br />
Catching up is only moments away, so sayonara.. until next time</p>
