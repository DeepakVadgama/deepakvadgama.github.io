I")	<p>I have a question for you, why are you called mau?…<br />
Is the softness, or the ferocity, which one represents thou?</p>

<p>Edgy personalities appeal to me, my search for them, result in only a few…<br />
But if a girl asked me about a complete person, I would ask her to idolize you</p>

<p>I have a thousand compliments to pay, nothing in return to reap…<br />
They are not included in this write-up, to avoid coming off as a creep</p>

<p>Come march, the dry city awaits you…<br />
Made wholesome by outsiders like us; locals are good too</p>

<p>Alive the city feels, with infinite malls, exquisite food outlets and the hip crowd..<br />
But finding inner peace can be hard, even the soul will have to shout out loud</p>

<p>I picture you on a humongous vessel some day…<br />
Accompanying the vastness of the seas, far from the bay</p>

<p>Elbows propped, pondering over a book and may be thoughts of a poem to write…<br />
Missing your parents, and the musketeers, it will keep you awake into the night</p>

<p>Your better half will come to heal, uninstigated, you won’t even have to move…<br />
You will then share life stories and experiences, smiles they will bring through</p>

<p>God speed to both of you, hope your relationship surpasses synergy…<br />
I imagine even your fights will rhyme and inevitable make-ups would be like poetry</p>

<p>Thanks for helping me find my pen, I owe it all to you…<br />
I’m not even close to being a poet, but it feels nice to have written a few</p>

<p>We are like 2 travelers crossing path, exchanging stories across sparks of bonfire…<br />
Under the starry night, pushing away the threat of cold and darkness’s ire</p>

<p>I re-read this poem, dear Lord, it is too mushy…<br />
If your fiancé misconstrues, I’ll need to hide some place bushy</p>

<p>I’ve always lagged years behind my maturity, while you are the opposite bit…<br />
Forgive me if this sounds like advice, hope one day, you deem it fit</p>

<p>Don’t lose your identity sister, show resistance and fight hard…<br />
If lost, an impossible treasure hunt it will be, the mining equipment will fall short</p>

<p>Adieu I say too soon, considering next 30 days will be a frenzy…<br />
I wish for only one thing… May you find your calling sensei</p>

<p>May.you.find.your.calling</p>
