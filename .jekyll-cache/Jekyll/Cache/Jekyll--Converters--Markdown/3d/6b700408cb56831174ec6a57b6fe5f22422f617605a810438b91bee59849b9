I";<p>It took months of lul, for us to truly believe youâ€™ve left foreverâ€¦  <br />
Usually I get by, unearthing memories of our times together</p>

<p>I wonder if we were typical siblings when young, with constant fighting and bickeringâ€¦  <br />
I regret our fights turning violent, but your revenge was fake tears with lips quivering</p>

<p>I guess we solidified the relationship during our college yearsâ€¦  <br />
Conversing in hindi, sharing everything from love life to many of our fears</p>

<p>Itâ€™s true what they say, the closest relationships are always taken for grantedâ€¦  <br />
It took me many years to realize, you were always the best sister anyone couldâ€™ve ever wanted</p>

<p>The first time you met Nimesh, you told me about how he seemed mild mannered and sweetâ€¦  <br />
To this day I second that sentiment, in addition to him being always positive and upbeat</p>

<p>With wedding getting closer and closer, days flew by so quick, my memory of it all is a blurâ€¦  <br />
You took all the decisions in your stride, then I realized how grown-up and mature you really were</p>

<p>Memories of the wedding, they give me shivers to this day; I wonder if the stress was worthwhileâ€¦  <br />
Then I look at the pics of you two dancing and laughing together; and my stress turns into a smile</p>

<p>You looked like a real princess, standing tall with the free flowing graceâ€¦  <br />
While he looked like an dignified aristocrat, with a smile and mischief on his face</p>

<p>The ceremony was so beautiful, with you two being the focus and all of its charmâ€¦  <br />
The sweetest moment though, has to be during <em>vidai</em> when Nimesh hugged our mom</p>

<p>He is so sweet and caring; its evident that the characteristic is at his coreâ€¦  <br />
He is protective as he is loving; so much so, that we donâ€™t worry about you anymore</p>

<p>You are moving towards far land with beautiful landscape and cleaner airâ€¦  <br />
Success will follow you to the far east, once youâ€™ve put in the effort and care</p>

<p>I know you are dying to visit the beaches and the australian wildâ€¦  <br />
This is the age to live, love and laugh; embrace your inner child</p>

<p>Donâ€™t look too far ahead, donâ€™t waste energy living the pastâ€¦  <br />
Enjoy the companionship, live in the moment, and have a blast</p>

<p>You compliment each other in almost all aspects and that makes you strongerâ€¦  <br />
Though, you both are too caring for this unfair world; steer clear of naive blunder</p>

<p>Relationships are about adjustments, compatibility &amp; picking your battlesâ€¦  <br />
Foundation built solid as a rock, world might quake but nothing within rattles</p>

<p>Even for small mistakes, we might scold you in-person or on hangoutsâ€¦  <br />
You might have your own young ones, but for us you will forever remain tots</p>

<p>Be prepared to host us in the faraway land, with red carpet and the silverwareâ€¦  <br />
We want to see all there is, including crocs, kangaroos, and the koala bear</p>

<p>The second time we visit you, I picture my niece awaiting us at the gateâ€¦  <br />
I wonder if the adorable doll will greet me as mama or just wave â€˜hey mateâ€™</p>

<p>Fly away my sweet birdies, soar and soar until you touch the skyâ€¦  <br />
Your dreams are for the taking; nothing this world can now deny<br />
In a tight mesh of many connections, we are nodes always close byâ€¦  <br />
Our book stays open, Iâ€™m only turning pages, not saying good-bye</p>
