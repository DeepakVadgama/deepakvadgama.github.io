I"z<p>Greetings city dwellers, Iâ€™m a morning dew drop..<br />
You might not know me, my discovery requires a long hop</p>

<p>I live in the wilderness, eternal vast and green.. <br />
I like to hide in the roses, to remain unseen</p>

<p>Shiny and sparkly I am, like a diamond lying around..<br />
Reflecting the world onto itself, projecting it small and round</p>

<p>Beauty seems abundant, I want to see it all for sure..<br />
I roll off the leaves briskly, like a traveller eager to explore</p>

<p>In the darkness I think and introspect as the world grows old..<br />
When the birds chirp its a sign, the visual glory about to unfold</p>

<p>With open arms I await my fate, while the time ticks ever so slow..<br />
It was glorious while it lasted, the morning sun has begun to glow</p>

<p>I perish every day as the world begins to stir.. <br />
Only to be resurrected when it succumbs to the blur</p>

<p>The world looks splendid as I near my total spend..<br />
I appreciate it even more, since nigh is my inevitable end</p>

<p>Akin to my shelf-life, this poem remains short.. <br />
Until tomorrow, signing off, the humble dew drop</p>
