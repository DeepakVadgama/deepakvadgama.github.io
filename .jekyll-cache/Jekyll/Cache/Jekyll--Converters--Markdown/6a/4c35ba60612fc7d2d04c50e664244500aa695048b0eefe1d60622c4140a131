I"1<p>Trail of blood, dripping down<br />
Sweat, dust and the frown<br />
Fellows being gunned down<br />
Us soldiers, move on and on</p>

<p>The brown of the chaos<br />
Intense, unfair pathos <br />
In the name of honor, paying costs<br />
Brothers in arms, in a just cause</p>

<p>Seemingly no end in sight<br />
In the fire of the night<br />
Sharing stories of life<br />
Shared pain, no strife</p>

<p>A ray of hope, waiting to ignite<br />
Apparent with progress in sight<br />
In eventual slope of alight<br />
Or, onwards in the journey of the fight</p>
