I"H<p>A speck of dust<br />
Was born and died<br />
A moment in time<br />
Subliminal for the universe<br />
An ageless tide</p>

<p>Born pure<br />
Molded with fear<br />
Grew resentful<br />
Forgotten mere</p>

<p>Unreasonable demands<br />
Unflinching, with no abort <br />
A far reaching vision   <br />
always falling short</p>

<p>A deadline slipped<br />
An event missed<br />
A conversation that hit<br />
Purity chipped, each bit</p>

<p>Confined himself<br />
In place and time<br />
The frog in a well<br />
Drew the line</p>

<p>Power and wealth <br />
As if elixir divine<br />
A ladder too high<br />
Of suffering &amp; crime</p>

<p>A journey inward<br />
Or the limitless outward<br />
Either, is the purpose<br />
Not this circus</p>

<p>A prayer modest<br />
To break confine<br />
Reach the bar<br />
Set by the divine</p>
