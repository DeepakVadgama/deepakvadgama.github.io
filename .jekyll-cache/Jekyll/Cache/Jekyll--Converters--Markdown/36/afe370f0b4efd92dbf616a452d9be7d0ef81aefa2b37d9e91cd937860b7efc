I"Í<p>Time has taken itâ€™s toll<br />
Inept in finding my role<br />
Attempts to bind myself in a whole<br />
Subsequent failures pecking at the soul</p>

<p>Finding myself over the hill <br />
Life seems drifting still<br />
Unable to find my keel<br />
Blind, moving with just the feel</p>

<p>Simmering visions of a made up desire<br />
Starts and chases haunted by failure<br />
Burned ceaselessly by my own ire<br />
Every positive intent halted by the listless fire</p>

<p>Weight of fitting in a mould<br />
Crumbling under expectations old<br />
Artillery of friends and neighbors bold<br />
Heavier still of family and the tight hold</p>

<p>Empathy, that I lately abide<br />
A relentless scam, a ruthless snide<br />
Unmirrored, I wish to change the side<br />
Or take the high road, avoid the fight</p>

<p>Cultures vary, but this is distraught<br />
A two front war cannot be fought<br />
Safety net should be sought<br />
Breaking free, encouraged, taught</p>
