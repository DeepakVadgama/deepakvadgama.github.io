I"Ý<p>I no longer watch movies about good vs evil, where portrayals are clear as dayâ€¦<br />
Instead I enjoy the ones, where morality lies on the ground painted gray</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s not because fighting evil is easy; itâ€™s not something I disregardâ€¦ <br />
Its because fighting your inner demons is way more hard</p>

<p>My love for Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged has remained unwavered, it didnâ€™t swayâ€¦ <br />
Iâ€™m glad the volumus flow didnâ€™t drag me to Chetan Bhagat and Fifty Shades of Gray</p>

<p>Whatsapp keeps complaining of unread messages, tries to tempt me into constant tappingâ€¦ <br />
Good luck with that; Iâ€™m no longer drawn to jokes which include â€˜I am still laughingâ€™</p>

<p>I still act like a child with more than two people aroundâ€¦ <br />
Core of being in a group is intellectual conversations or just humor abound</p>

<p>Paradoxical it seems that I like to spend time with people who are edgyâ€¦ <br />
This repetitive nature of life calls for interesting characters to keep the CPU busy</p>

<p>I realize now history is not to be taken for grantedâ€¦<br />
Itâ€™s written by the victorious who claim their land eternally enchanted</p>

<p>I question the veracity of rewards and accumulation of wealthâ€¦ <br />
For years, money and corruption have changed the rules in stealth</p>

<p>You might think I have become a cynic, an unlikable pessimistâ€¦ <br />
I donâ€™t believe in the made-up world anymore; Iâ€™m more of a realist</p>

<p>Depression overwhelms me sometimes, though I no longer cryâ€¦ <br />
Listening to idols is my medicine for it, one of them is Stephen Fry</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not scared anymore when my opinions go against the crowdâ€¦ <br />
My thoughts have settled in, after years of being round and about</p>

<p>I now tread with caution, even when the situation is direâ€¦<br />
Impulse doesnâ€™t help one bit, Iâ€™ve been burned twice by fire</p>

<p>I am more respectful and tolerant; it paid immense dividendsâ€¦<br />
Iâ€™ve seen people do amazing things, itâ€™s stupid to have any arrogance</p>

<p>My curiosity to learn, recently has got lot of pamperingâ€¦<br />
Though with so much to learn, its not helping, its hampering</p>

<p>I dream of working for fun and still charge a feeâ€¦<br />
Though I confess, laziness has not yet let go of me</p>

<p>Life keeps offering these clues, all it takes is listeningâ€¦<br />
Only way to enjoy life in the long run, is by being disciplined</p>

<p>Life has so much to offer, thereâ€™s still much to unlockâ€¦ <br />
The island across is far but at least Iâ€™ve reached the dock</p>

<p>Life is coming full circle, from spontaneous and rash teenage blundersâ€¦ <br />
Onto boring adulthood; and back again to self-discovery &amp; itâ€™s wonders</p>

<p>No one is born with depth, you eventually discover it with ageâ€¦ <br />
Its ironically shallow to dive into; it just takes coming out of the cage</p>

<p>Oblivious to the chaos, carrying content of a sageâ€¦ <br />
The world makes sense again, this is my coming of age</p>
