I"ý<p>Relationships are the silk strands connecting souls like me and youâ€¦ <br />
I donâ€™t understand them fully, but let me point similarities between the two</p>

<p>Insubstantial they look to the naked eye, so evident is their fragilityâ€¦ <br />
Like heartbeats and breaths, taken for granted is their vitality</p>

<p>They come in many forms, each being subtly differentâ€¦ <br />
Smooth and shiny they feel, until we face the ones affront</p>

<p>While young and curious, we are built a prison of silk; equal parts isolated and bareâ€¦ <br />
Parents ignore our pleads to break out; oblivious they are to the wilderness out there</p>

<p>At tender age when a princess connects, the heart dreams for lifespan right then and thereâ€¦<br />
When that strand is tugged too hard too soon, it breaks apart, and I think thatâ€™s only fair</p>

<p>The fall is hard if leaning on the strand; thousand complains of pain and of life being unfairâ€¦ <br />
Getting up takes a while; but the lesson is learned in importance of patience and care</p>

<p>Over the years, the strands reach out to hundreds, seeding new friends all aroundâ€¦ <br />
They together form the safety net, making it your inner childâ€™s playground</p>

<p>Time takes its toll on the strands though, few wither away every other yearâ€¦ <br />
Each one is cherished for a bit; remaining ones, well, forever you hold them dear</p>

<p>You team up with your queen by tying the knot, like rock climbers on a cliff sharing a ropeâ€¦ <br />
That strand is stronger than steel yet lighter than feather, even the mightiest obstacles fail to cope</p>

<p>The day comes when you create a cocoon to protect your childâ€¦ <br />
Because youâ€™ve seen the world out there, and nothing about it is mild</p>

<p>One strand holds still, omnipresent in the stretch between ashes and birthâ€¦ <br />
Visible only through lenses of faith, it stretches from heaven to the earth</p>

<p>Astronauts know how small we are in the scheme of things; how petty are our differences and fightsâ€¦ <br />
The world is a mesh of billions of connections; each one twinkles, as it transfers pulses of lights</p>

<p>Keep spinning them; more connections are better than just a fewâ€¦ <br />
A spider never runs out of silk and with Godâ€™s grace, neither will you</p>
