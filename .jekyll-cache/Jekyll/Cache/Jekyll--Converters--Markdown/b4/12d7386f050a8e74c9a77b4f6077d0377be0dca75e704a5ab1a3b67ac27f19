I"k<p>Save me..  <br />
For my repentance won’t age  <br />
For my mind won’t pledge  <br />
For my sins won’t hedge  <br />
For the monkey isn’t caged</p>

<p>Save me..  <br />
From the consuming addiction  <br />
From the lack of conviction  <br />
From the flailing volition  <br />
From the laziness within</p>

<p>Save me..  <br />
From this baseless jealousy  <br />
From this material fallacy  <br />
From the needs superfluous  <br />
From the struggle tenuous</p>

<p>Save me..  <br />
From this pinned delusion  <br />
From this grand deception  <br />
From the constant stimuli  <br />
From the inner strife</p>

<p>Save me..  <br />
For it’s dark through the day  <br />
For this cruelty won’t abate  <br />
For the voice grows meek  <br />
For the foundation is weak</p>

<p>Save me..  <br />
For I beg you Mother  <br />
For it’s only you, none other  <br />
For I can’t win on my own  <br />
For your gifts aren’t adorn</p>

<p>Save me..  <br />
For you are merciful  <br />
For your love is unconditional  <br />
For you’ve saved plentiful  <br />
For I will be eternal dutiful</p>

<p>Save me</p>
