<h3 id="event-management">Event Management</h3>

<p>Kudos to a very well managed event. Shuttles for pickups and drops, huge rooms for talks, ample comfortable seating areas with beanbags, wonderful catering.. it was extremely well thought-out. 
The Google staff was courteous and extremely helpful throughout the 2 days. 
Entire event was very smooth and yet highly energetic, despite being attended by probably a 1000 developers.</p>

<h3 id="talks">Talks</h3>

<p>There were <a href="https://developers.google.com/events/gdd-india/schedule/day1">3 tracks</a> for talks and trainings over 2 days</p>

<p>Here are the ones I attended</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZRczPw1BBw&amp;index=24&amp;list=PLlyCyjh2pUe_Xyqy9K6sBxwr0L8QaU7dq">Mobile in Context: Design Principle of Flow and Navigation</a> by Jenny Gove. First of the 2 best talks for me. It had no fluff; only great examples, screenshots, stats and guidelines.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEw_n_wsk1o">Lighthouse, Headless Chrome, and Puppeteer</a> by Eric Bidelman and Vinamrata Singal. Second of the 2 best talks for me. Amazing amount of detail; code-snippets, screenshots, tips and much-more compressed in a 30 minute session.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciXFnhsI0R0&amp;index=26&amp;list=PLlyCyjh2pUe_Xyqy9K6sBxwr0L8QaU7dq">Running in the Background</a> by Nasir Khan. This talk was about running Android tasks in the background.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecWu8s5nIhY">Actionable Insights</a> by Amrit Sanjeev. This talk was about Firebase Prediction tools announced earlier this year.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER9L6Gg3HrE&amp;t=4s">Testing out Kotlin</a> by Sean McQuillan. Unfortunately, this required advanced Kotlin knowledge which I donâ€™t have.</li>
  <li>Building Production IoT Devices with Android Things by Wayne Piekarski.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of the talks were live streamed and are available to watch on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlyCyjh2pUe_Xyqy9K6sBxwr0L8QaU7dq">Google Developers India Youtube channel</a></p>

<p>I missed a few which I was looking forward to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cloud Functions</li>
  <li>Design thinking workshop by Stanford</li>
  <li>Hands-on with the Google Cloud Vision and Natural Language APIs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<p>I could only attend one training - â€˜Build a Web App with Firebase and Cloud Firestoreâ€™ led by Arthur Thompson. 
We live-coded <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firestore-web/#0">a Restaurant listing web-app</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sandboxes">Sandboxes</h3>
<p>This was one of the more popular areas of the conference. Lot of small booths showcasing Googleâ€™s products.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Here I got to know about <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Lighthouse</a> an Google Chrome extension which provides feedback on the websites.</li>
  <li>Saw couple of cool demos made with <a href="https://developer.android.com/things/index.html">Android things</a></li>
  <li>Gave feedback to Firebase team about incremental commit-sync for static hosting</li>
  <li>Saw GCPâ€™s Video Intelligence API demos. Was awesome.</li>
  <li>Pluralsight promotion (offered 2 months free subscription for those who complete a small Android IQ test)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="codelabs">Codelabs</h3>
<p>There was a dedicated section with workstations to try out <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/">all the code-labs</a> available for Google platforms. 
Googlers were available to help resolve any issues. 
I wish I had done couple of them at the event. Well, maybe next time.</p>

<h3 id="community-lounge">Community Lounge</h3>
<p>Lot of lightning-talks were held at the community lounge randing from â€˜Solve for Indiaâ€™ to â€˜Networking Skillsâ€™.

<h3 id="swag">Swag</h3>
<p>Every developer at the event got an Android Things <a href="https://developer.android.com/things/hardware/imx7d-kit.html">Pico pro maker kit</a>. Canâ€™t wait to get hacking away at this.</p>

<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Great Google/event staff. Everyone was courteous and extremely helpful. Zero hiccups. keep going!</li>
  <li>Talks by <a href="https://twitter.com/jennylg">Jenny Gove</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ebidel">Eric Bildeman</a> were perfect templates. Lot of in-depth technical details, examples and stats. I wish more talks were like these.</li>
  <li>Some talks should have been split between beginners and advanced. 
For example: talk about Kubernetes was neither a good introduction nor in-depth architecture overview. 
No qualms against the host though, as 30 minutes is too short for a Kubernetes scale subject.</li>
  <li>Get view of attendanceâ€™s interest beforehand with a online poll and assign rooms accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall it was a wonderful event! Well managed, lot of talks, insightful discussions, meeting fellow developers and lot more.</p>

<p>Thank you all at Google for inviting me and hosting a wonderful conference!</p>
