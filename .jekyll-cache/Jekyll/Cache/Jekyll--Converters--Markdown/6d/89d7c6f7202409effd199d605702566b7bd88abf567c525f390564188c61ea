I"Õ<p>a pebble laid, in a garden of eden<br />
teeming with movement &amp; green</p>

<p>self-aware, highly keen<br />
eternally inanimate, unseen</p>

<p>motionless, longing for elation<br />
unceasingly, it wondered â€˜creationâ€™</p>

<p>fate arrived, in a playful mood<br />
euphoric, to have finally moved</p>

<p>no agency, a fact rife<br />
yet quivering, with virgin life</p>

<p>so many emotions, left it dazed<br />
towards the sky, feeling amazed</p>

<p>reaching zenith, it came to rest<br />
moment of stillness, meditative crest</p>

<p>strong belief became a dissonant theory<br />
the dull pain, a distant memory</p>

<p>the joy of love<br />
the spark of life</p>

<p>two stars circling, the dance &amp; pull<br />
closer and closer, the bliss &amp; swoon</p>

<p>universe a remnant, the merge superior<br />
two lovers, ecstasy, wild &amp; clear</p>

<p>too naive, to realize own identity<br />
evanescent joy, mistaken for personality</p>

<p>the downward fall, began to take<br />
a senseless hope, that its a fake</p>

<p>acutely aware of blunder, began self pity<br />
even blind cannot be forgiven, for such credulity</p>

<p>crashing back, to the grim reality <br />
shattering the dim illusion of sanity</p>

<p>memories of zenith, stuck forever<br />
fueling fire of demise, ever and ever</p>

<p>cruel it thought, to see a glimmer of hope<br />
then cast away, an unwanted trope</p>

<p>incessant pain, repeatedly analyzed<br />
crying for release, lying paralyzed</p>
