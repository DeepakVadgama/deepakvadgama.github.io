I"©<p>In self<br />
Or someone else<br />
In karma<br />
Or the Divine</p>

<p>Prerequisites experiences galore<br />
Intimate knowledge afore<br />
Constant trials before<br />
Cycles of turning back and more</p>

<p>Proportional to the misgiving<br />
Crossing the chasm, often unforgiving<br />
Mandates deep sacrifice<br />
Such hardship, denouncing own vice</p>

<p>Innocence carries such weight<br />
Rationals call it blind faith<br />
Road paved with much queer<br />
Held back by logic and fear</p>

<p>The bridge to infinite wonder, ariel<br />
Tethered to the ground, material<br />
Not even dimly visible<br />
Seemingly barely credible</p>

<p>Only vibrations of evidence<br />
Teachings of guides, the only providence<br />
Eons of battles, fought hard<br />
Just to discover head of the path</p>

<p>Be meticulous, it‚Äôs not a spree<br />
Take your time, judge not thee<br />
Hand over the key<br />
Forget the ‚Äúme‚Äù</p>
