I"Å<p>They pity the fool  <br />
They saw him in despair <br />
Help him at once, for we‚Äôre wiser <br />
Our belief, we must share</p>

<p>Tie the knot, they said <br />
With someone who cares <br />
Its established, this world <br />
Is only made for pairs</p>

<p>Stop the vigilance, tending <br />
they continued, the caloric quantity <br />
Being thin, a sign of the weak <br />
Hazardous even, an unfit personality</p>

<p>Buy a home, a car <br />
They‚Äôre a life‚Äôs measure  <br />
Portray the success <br />
Convert your treasure</p>

<p>Go out, mingle <br />
Don‚Äôt bear, belong, at the party <br />
Being alone amongst billions <br />
Doesn‚Äôt fit; its out of place, tardy</p>

<p>For happiness that eludes me,  <br />
they‚Äôve attained, I presume <br />
The secret I yearned for <br />
they‚Äôve unlocked, I assume</p>

<p>They care, they try, constantly <br />
For the fool, to attain a joyful life <br />
End the friction between us sects <br />
They call for an end to this strife</p>

<p>O‚Äô world, said the fool  <br />
I am grateful, for unearned <br />
your compassion, the grants <br />
I empathize, your helpless struggle</p>

<p>For the price to evolve<br />
to conform, is too high<br />
Breaking free, harder even<br />
She continues the try</p>

<p>I am no fool, mind you  <br />
Its worse, arrogant, dumb <br />
Being lured into innocence <br />
Waiting lifetimes to succumb</p>
