I"4<p>‘God’ is an enigma which I was determined to unravel..<br />
Curiosity brought knowledge with it, and the thoughts began to travel</p>

<p>Before we begin though, heed caution: this poem might make you puffy and red..<br />
If that happens, don’t let it ruin your day; call me dumb and just move ahead</p>

<p>God is a fact, full of contradictions; which theories can’t convey with terse..<br />
God permeates in every atom; yet is a whole, engulfing the universe</p>

<p>God is kind and ever forgiving; yet is always just..<br />
God is an ally all powerful; yet our luck never seems to thrust</p>

<p>The former is God’s inert nature, while the latter Her energy called <em>karma</em>..<br />
It is a balancing act based on our past deeds; scriptures call it <em>dharma</em></p>

<p>We curse constantly about being kind yet receiving sticks we don’t deserve..<br />
Failing to grasp the stretch of time, which flattens our actions’ shaky curve</p>

<p>Infinite lifetimes we travelled afar; between hell, heaven and earth..<br />
Love for God is the only path, that breaks the cycle of death and the inevitable rebirth</p>

<p>This simple act of ‘attachment to God’ is lot easier said than done..<br />
Try to focus for even 30 seconds and observe yourself being undone</p>

<p>Think of the wondrous cosmos and its intricate workings, this form of Hers is called <em>nirguna</em>..<br />
Or think of Her <em>leelas</em> as manifestations on earth; these forms of <em>avatars</em> are called <em>saguna</em></p>

<p>Think of this material world as an endless ordeal, where all actions lead to misery..<br />
Or think of earth as a place of happiness, which God gave us to value Her company</p>

<p>God’s forms are infinite, approach whichever one appeals to you..<br />
Beauty lies in Her personal bond with all, not just a chosen few</p>

<p>Getting rid of our earthly duties is not mandated; nor does She command specific asks..<br />
Love is all she needs and all we can give; there are no other God’s “tasks”</p>

<p>Love and forgiveness are personifications of God, you’re not an outcast..<br />
She pleads ‘come to me as you are, don’t be guilty of your past’</p>

<p>Instill humility, kindness and love within; until they become an everyday chore..<br />
They are a reflection of Her qualities, soon you’ll start feeling Her in your core</p>

<p>Material world needs are infinite; they become incessantly greedy..<br />
I try not to fuel the fire; they themselves are deceptively needy</p>

<p>Aforementioned cycles are equally strong yet ruthlessly effective..<br />
Step back and think it through, choose one with a calm collective</p>

<p>Seek and read and watch and learn; Her knowledge is precinct everywhere..<br />
Kripalu, Mira, Aurobindo, Kabir, so many screamed the Truth, yet we act unaware</p>

<p>The more you research the right literature, the clearer it all gets..<br />
Though it’s advised to follow just one of many, else plenty confusion sets</p>

<p>Focus and discipline go hand in hand, and I believe they are the only way..<br />
Faith and humility are your strongest pillars, helping oppose any other sway</p>

<p>You are waiting for happiness, it’s your birth right, long overdue..<br />
Open your mind and run steadfast; with arms spread, She is calling you</p>

<p>PS:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The poem above is based on my understanding of <a href="http://jkp.org/">Kripalu Maharajji’s</a> lectures [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA3B03C8320853BC2">Hindi</a>, <a href="http://www.swaminikhilanandlectures.org/sanatan.html">English</a>]. They are very <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl_0QrDr0-0">simple</a>, clear, yet logical. I have not researched too deep, but enough to gauge the basic fundamentals in teachings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Aurobindo">Sri Aurobindo</a>, <a href="http://www.iskcon.org/">ISKCON</a> and <a href="http://www.brahmakumaris.org/">Brahmakumaris</a>.</li>
  <li>I recommend reading books(literature) penned by founders of these movements. Actions guided by these teachings can be misinterpreted or <em>possibly</em> diluted or changed over the years. Core literature on the other hand, remains the same.</li>
  <li>Most of these are variations of larger <em>Bhakti movement</em> on India (16th Century). Evolution of this philosophy is discussed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i_7R96_tAI">this video</a></li>
  <li>Title of the poem should be interpreted as ‘My attempt at understanding God rationally’.</li>
  <li>I address God as Her because I relate to God’s form of <em>Radha</em>.</li>
