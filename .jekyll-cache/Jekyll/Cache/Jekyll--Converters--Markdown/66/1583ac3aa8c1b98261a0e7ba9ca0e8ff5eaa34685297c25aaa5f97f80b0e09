I"à<p>From afar, life seems full of mystery and wonder.. <br />
Yet, inescapable is the sea of turmoil, hidden under</p>

<p>Amidst these rough seas, we attempt to grasp lifeâ€™s rudder ..<br />
Trying perpetually to get control of it, while it keeps drifting farther</p>

<p>Time flows eternally; sprouting decision tree all through life..<br />
Though choosing one path over another is always tangled in strife</p>

<p>These decisions come with a strong sway; reflecting everything but totality..<br />
Often forced on by circumstances; sometimes, a herd like mentality</p>

<p>Over the years, I have met only a few, so utterly convinced.. <br />
I ponder over their rituals, their values, how they persist</p>

<p>Is it faith that pulls them, cutting through the foliage of barriers.. <br />
Or can they visualize the dream upfront, making it their carrier</p>

<p>Is it a gut feeling, an internal radar personifying inner freedom.. <br />
Or is it a cold hearted decision, drawn with mathematical precision</p>

<p>Once the path is laid out, are they unhinged, unwavered in their quest..   <br />
Or is there still skepticism, about long road ahead, little flutters in the chest</p>

<p>Is it the zealousness shown by dreamers of the day..   <br />
A narrow cone of vision, keeping all fears at bay</p>

<p>Do they reaffirm the faith by constant discipline and practice..   <br />
Or is it only natural, once the neural paths are established</p>

<p>Are they quick adapters who criss-cross paths upon new information..<br />
Or do they sustain, until within touching distance is their aspiration</p>

<p>Does the terrain affect their path, or instead does it make them leap.. <br />
Does the energy come from a source within, or is it the company they keep</p>

<p>Their drive is an enigma to me, which I hope to unravel..<br />
Forever theyâ€™ll remain my inspiration, my grapple</p>

<p>Rare are those who have it down to utter conviction..<br />
My path still being fallible, they have my undying admiration</p>
