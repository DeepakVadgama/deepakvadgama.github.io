I"·<p>Blades of morning grass<br />
Swayed in fresh breeze<br />
The dew drops, the stream,<br />
The garden, the trees</p>

<p>â€œDeepakâ€, words rung<br />
They broke my reverie<br />
Awake or asleep this instant?<br />
A condition, so weary</p>

<p>Sharp out of daze<br />
It was your smile <br />
Just your presence<br />
Enough to drift awhile</p>

<p>You moved with abandon<br />
The skirtâ€™s twist &amp; turn<br />
Elegance personified<br />
My quest to discern</p>

<p>You stopped and stared<br />
Piercing deep brown eyes<br />
Intoxicating, the charm<br />
Hypnotic, frozen, effusive tries</p>

<p>Your being inspires poetry<br />
Fervent, beauty divine<br />
Lips to embarrass a rose<br />
The moan to still even time</p>

<p>Close as touch,<br />
Yet unreachable, a crest<br />
Each tick, a lifetime<br />
An indefinite test</p>

<p>Such beauty, the urge<br />
To whisk you off your feet<br />
Or swoon over your elegance<br />
On my knees, entreat</p>

<p>Unbounded love<br />
Winged but not yet wild<br />
Only smiles &amp; glances<br />
Akin a helpless child</p>

<p>Yhe agony, the confusion<br />
Punishment and bethrow<br />
â€˜I deserveâ€™, an illusion<br />
Soul pleads, forgive &amp; forgo</p>

<p>Elusive, this rapture <br />
Embrace the flow<br />
For once, my love<br />
Just let go</p>

<p>Epilogue:<br />
â€œBeauty in eyes of beholderâ€, <br />
She said in kind<br />
With smile and a shake, I told her<br />
â€œThe world is blindâ€</p>
