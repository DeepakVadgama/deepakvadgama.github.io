I"0<p>A game always afoot<br />
Different versions of self<br />
Each tailored, balanced<br />
For a person or a situation</p>

<p>A version to make them laugh<br />
A version to boast of empty shell<br />
A version to mirror expectation<br />
A version to cry alone</p>

<p>One, even for friends<br />
One, even for the partner<br />
One, even for the family<br />
One amorphous for everyone else</p>

<p>True self always lurks<br />
Hidden in the shadows<br />
Calling the shots<br />
An evil puppeteer</p>

<p>Petrified<br />
Of being laughed at<br />
Of being judged<br />
Of being an outcast<br />
Of being exposed</p>

<p>This fear of self worth<br />
A sad constant<br />
Amongst speeding electrons<br />
To inevitable big bangs</p>

<p>Fear unknown to age<br />
Yearning for love<br />
Yearning for acceptance<br />
Yearning for self worth</p>

<p>Self value<br />
Validated externally<br />
Oh the irony<br />
The illogical bedrock<br />
Boundary for a lesser life</p>

<p>I am sorry<br />
I apologize<br />
I regress<br />
Too often</p>

<p>Time is an enemy<br />
Amnesia for my mistakes<br />
For my blunt actions<br />
For the destruction Iâ€™ve caused</p>

<p>Bring your calm, my grace<br />
A touch to the core <br />
To this disturbed water<br />
Sending ripples out<br />
Calm. Still. Transparent</p>

<p>Help me tame the monster<br />
It feeds and grows<br />
Exerts more control<br />
Thaws my essence, crows</p>

<p>A helpless servant<br />
To my own ego<br />
Aspiring to change allegiance<br />
Get rid of, overthrow</p>

<p>Only one unbearable pull<br />
Only one source of tears<br />
An approval of my existence<br />
An instruction of letting go</p>

<p>A safe space of loving embrace<br />
An inescapable shield<br />
Of protection from self<br />
Harbor of unconditional love</p>

<p>Only you, Mother! Only you!</p>
