I"»<p>Being a freelancer and working from home in India turned out to be different than I anticipated, primarily due to</p>

<ul>
  <li>Budget - I donâ€™t earn enough to splurge on a <a href="http://store.hermanmiller.com/Products/Aeron-Chair">$1000 chair</a> or a <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S4RfkcM1Dx8/maxresdefault.jpg">triple monitor setup</a></li>
  <li>Equipment Availability - 80% of equipment worth buying is not available in India.</li>
  <li>India is diverse - Where I stay (Mumbai suburbs), electricity is a not an omnipresent entity (yeah, tell me about it).</li>
</ul>

<p>After months of tweaking, I settled on following setup:</p>

<h2 id="desk">Desk</h2>

<p>I found only <a href="http://www.primaplastics.com/images/product-trolleys/trolleys_computer_big.png">one</a> in India fitting my needs. It is cheap (2,000 INR) and narrow (helps with my limited bedroom space). More importantly, it has keyboard deck much lower than monitor base (ergonomically correct). I still had to use books to further increase this distance.</p>

<p>One I have: <a href="http://www.primaplastics.com/images/product-trolleys/trolleys_computer_big.png">Prima Plastics</a> (Not available online)</p>

<h2 id="chair">Chair</h2>
<p>I cannot understate importance of getting this right. I started experiencing lower back pain within few weeks. These injuries are recurrent and can last decades.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure good lower back support. I use an extra cushion for this.</li>
  <li>Chair height and keyboard placement should allow shoulders to be in relaxed state.</li>
  <li>Ensure chair is at good height such legs are not pressing too much against the chair cushion (that cuts off the blood flow).</li>
  <li>Checkout <a href="http://deepakvadgama.com/images/ergonomics.jpg">this image</a> for ergonomics.</li>
</ul>

<p>Budget option: Similar to <a href="http://www.pepperfry.com/ergonomic-chairs-by-emperor-1104811.html">this</a><br />

<h2 id="monitor">Monitor</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Opt for a monitor with matte display, it reduces the glare. The colors are not as bright as glossy screens, but hey, for a developer it shouldnâ€™t matter.</li>
  <li>IPS displays are better than TFT displays for color reproduction.</li>
  <li>LED backlight helps save on electricity costs.</li>
  <li>Opt for at least 1080p resolution if budget allows.</li>
  <li>Keep the brightness and contrast to appropriate levels. Mine is 25% brightness and 50% contrast. Out of the box default values are much higher.</li>
  <li>Ensure appropriate monitor height matching eye level. I use good old books for the same. <em>Update:</em> Not anymore, see next point.</li>
  <li>Consider mounting the monitor on the wall with adjustable arms. <em>Update:</em> I recently got <a href="http://www.amazon.in/CNCT-Displays-genuine-Product-picture/dp/B00N6PH6GW/">one</a>. Turned out to be cheap yet rock solid.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mouse">Mouse</h2>

<p>I started developing wrist pain due to sideways movements. I bought this vertical mouse, and though its not perfect, it helped a lot to alleviate the pain.</p>

<p>Budget option: <a href="http://www.amazon.in/Circle-Sniper-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B00EZONAA4">Circle Sniper</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00GA2EWM4">Mousepad</a><br />

<h2 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h2>

<p>I have a split keyboard, though expensive, has been serving me well for years now. Thus, I am not aware of a good budget keyboard. Iâ€™d suggest ones with soft keys and a good wristpad.</p>

<p>One I have: <a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-for-pc-us/">Kinesys Freestyle 2</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B0013CF4FK">Wristpad</a><br />

<h2 id="webcam">Webcam</h2>

<p>There is not much to the webcams. They are cheap and they do their job well.</p>

<p>Budget: <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/logitech-c310-hd-webcam/p/itmczzccgktpvkjy">Logitech C310</a><br />

<h2 id="lighting-conditions">Lighting conditions</h2>

<p>Blue light <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side">disturbs sleep cycles</a> and complete darkness hurts the eyes. I follow these rules to maintain the right luminosity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Day times: Keep windows open to let surrounding (halo) light in. It should not hit the monitor directly though (to avoid glare).</li>
  <li>Night times: Use a warm-white bulb/tube light (I use <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/philips-9-5-w-led-b22-3000k-a55-ind-bulb/p/itmef3hhfzfzf2vn">this one</a>). Opt for LED bulb with 3000k to 4000k temperature rating.</li>
  <li>Monitor lights: Use <a href="http://jonls.dk/redshift/">redshift</a> or <a href="https://justgetflux.com/">flux</a> to limit amount of blue light monitor emits during night times.</li>
  <li>Android phone: Similar <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.lumen&amp;hl=en">software for Android</a> in case, like me, you browse in bed at night.</li>
</ul>

<p>These might sound like overkill, but I experienced stark difference with and without them. Also, overall costs for all above points is less than 400 INR.</p>

<h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2>

<p>I stay in Mumbai suburbs where electricity is off for few hours a week.</p>

<ul>
  <li>SMPS - Critical to get good quality SMPS for your Desktop. Low/high voltage can wreck all components. I have <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/seasonic-s12ii-430-watts-psu/p/itmd5xz5bzevdbzp">Seasonic S12II</a>.</li>
  <li>UPS - Good UPS can give you 3-5 hours of backup. Not many options in India though - <a href="http://www.amazon.in/APC-UPS-Model-BR1000G-IN-Battery/dp/B0038ZTZ3W">APC</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.in/APC-BR24BPG-Back-UPS-External-Battery/dp/B0047E5B90">extra-battery</a>.</li>
  <li>Internet - Hook up router to your UPS to ensure uninterrupted internet connectivity. Worst case use Smartphone 3G <a href="https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/2812516?hl=en">hotspot</a>.</li>
  <li>Laptop - I have a laptop (my backup device) for just-in-case situations. Also helps when meeting clients.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this helps. Comment below if you need any help/advice.</p>

<p>Happy working from home!</p>
