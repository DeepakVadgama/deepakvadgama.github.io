I"Œ<p>Hi buddy, howâ€™s life, she said.. <br />
Hey girl, long time no see, he said</p>

<p>Let me tell you about this wonderful guy I met recently.. <br />
I met a girl too, only if we shared bit more frequently</p>

<p>He is strong, stable, like a pillar.. <br />
She has a heart of gold, her looks are killer</p>

<p>He is feared; lot of respect he commands.. <br />
She is ferocious when situation demands</p>

<p>He is like a lion, the king of the jungle.. <br />
She belongs to the sky, a star with a twinkle</p>

<p>He cheers me up every time I am sad..<br />
Her company itself suffices for me, I feel so glad</p>

<p>He picks up the slack when I leave some.. <br />
She encourages me to push myself like Iâ€™ve never done</p>

<p>He thinks clearly, his decisions are based on logic and sense.. <br />
She gets so many things done, yet it never gets tense</p>

<p>His stories are engrossing, we are sometimes up until five.. <br />
She debates with me constantly, itâ€™s never boring, things are always alive</p>

<p>He is so attune to my feelings, always listening, always interested.. <br />
She is cheerful, bubbly, wild, completely uninhibited</p>

<p>Iâ€™m in love, it all worked out, Iâ€™m marrying my stud soon.. <br />
It didnâ€™t for me, Iâ€™ll keep looking, in daylight and under the moon</p>

<p>It was great talking to you, good luck, she said.. <br />
Ditto, my lady, until we meet again, he said</p>
