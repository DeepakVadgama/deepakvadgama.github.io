I"j<p>Its easy to catch the virus of your infectious smile.. <br />
After talking to you, the cheer stays with me for a while</p>

<p>Akin to a river, uninhibited is your extravagant grace.. <br />
Like a feather floating in the wind, silently, without a trace</p>

<p>I cannot overstate, the preciousness of the fact that you are sensible..<br />
The characteristic is so rare, it makes you that much more indispensable</p>

<p>You are a perfect amalgam of logic, intellect and relentless ferocity.. <br />
I know you without knowing you; no point getting into the nitty-gritty</p>

<p>It’s impressive, the sheer talent you possess.. <br />
The day is near when you will taste sweet success</p>

<p>People will sympathize and share the laundry list of things for you to do.. <br />
They don’t realize you just want to be heard, such are people, what to do</p>

<p>They will also claim, ‘things happen, it’s a blessing in disguise’.. <br />
You won’t agree, but don’t explode and cut them down to size</p>

<p>If you wish to speak to someone, I am all ears..<br />
I am also here for you, to allay any of your fears</p>

<p>Painful as it is now, in hindsight it will be labeled a farce.. <br />
Now stand up, dust yourself and get back on that horse</p>

<p>Giving advice to you is unnecessary, almost senseless..<br />
We think of you as a fighter; our warrior princess</p>
