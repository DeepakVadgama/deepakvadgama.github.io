<p>Hey there</p>

<p>I am primarily a Java developer with 11 years of experience, having worked with HSBC, J.P.Morgan and Nomura for ~10 years. 
 I also worked as tech lead in a 4 person <em>failed</em> start-up <a href="https://deepakvadgama.com/projects/perils-of-startup">chat2get.com</a> for span of 10 months.</p>

<p>From October-2015 until March-2017, I was CTO and co-founder of services company ‘Mindfort Tech’. During this time, I primarily worked with cable/wire manufacturing company called <a href="https://balajiwires.in">Balaji Wires</a>. As a sole developer, I created their <a href="https://balajiwires.in">website</a> based on wordpress, and enhanced their <a href="https://deepakvadgama.com/projects/refactoring-to-sanity/">ERP software</a>.</p>

<p>Details of most of my projects can be found <a href="https://deepakvadgama.com/projects/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I have experience working with Spring Boot, AngularJS, Google Cloud and have <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801">Udacity Android Nanodegree</a>. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LgFWkJshx94o0DCmTvFmd_dlUNva9Vc4W7PAchhh3q4/edit?usp=sharing">My resume</a> (as of August-2017).</p>

<p>I like to keep abreast with technology news. I am also a fan of Roger Federer, Heath Ledger and Google.</p>
