excerpt: Working in a large enterprise as a Lead Developer

Outline
- Spring Boot Migration
- Creating Chatbot for Symphony?
- Internal sessions
- Culture change
- Cloud Foundry

- Migrating to Spring Boot
App with 1.2m requests, load balanced across 4 tomcats
Request params, Servlets + web.xml, 
Huge class for manually inject dependencies

- Culture of unnecessary complexity
Pass single tomcat, expensive restarts with having strict SLAs. 
Things change, dedicated tomcats now. 

DB change dynamic update can be dangerous. Case in point: ThreadPool replacement on DB change.
There is also a culture of 'what if in the future'

Agile working for us and not other way around. Again manager support very important. 

- Lead developer
I was empowered by my manager's complete support and my position as a lead developer.

- Sessions 
Spring Boot (mostly was ), Testing in Java (link for Github repo), Git (ppt link), Microservices (ppt link)

- Jenkins Pipeline?

- Cloud Foundry push
Certification? Migration to CF

- Conclusion
Important to have management support (the world on fire due to DevOps and 'Silicon Vally is coming' scare helps too). This has helped push the agile ideas too.
