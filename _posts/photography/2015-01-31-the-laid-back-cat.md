It took me 30 minutes to take a few pictures of this cat (most of them are either boring or blurry). She was didn't care for me, honestly. Cats are very independent and don't care about anyone as long as they are fed and kept warm.

Anyways, I'm glad I got a close up, where the eyes are sharp and peering.

Taken at 40mm, F2.8, 1/160
