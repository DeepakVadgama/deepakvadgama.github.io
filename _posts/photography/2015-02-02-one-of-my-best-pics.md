excerpt: One of my favorite pictures, taken in NYC, near Statue Of Liberty.
---

It is difficult to pick a favorite picture out of thousands. Having said that, there are a few I am particularly proud how they turned out to be.

Below is one such picture (original at the bottom), taken in NYC near Statue Of Liberty.

Wonderfully dressed young girl, peering into the tower viewer, looking far off at some sort of factory (which oddly resembles old houses), everything else is hazy which accentuates the view. Even the ordinary thing like railings enhance the fact that the far off view being looked at doesn't belong to this world. It all just fits.
