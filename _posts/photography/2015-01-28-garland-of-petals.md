excerpt: Slightly baffling at first, close look at garland of petals.

These are few pics I took during my Udupi trip in 2012. It is difficult initially to figure out what the pics are of. They are actually garland made of petals (crep jasmine) stacked on top of each other.

Taken at 40mm, F5, 1/640
