Freshers =
Appropriate training programs ... pluralsight codecademy
spent money
books
yet they need exact courses which is fine
but give up as soon as they find it difficult and ask for something else

DB developer = 
no google, no stackoverflow, just ping
which is fine for a bit
but hindrance in the long run (2 years)

downtime, learn something new... doesnt work, need a project then only can do
which is ofcourse not true, look at all the MOOCs (which btw have hands on tutorials)
will do when project comes, but then same cycle starts, slightest bit of trouble and ping

Developer ecosystem is massive
Use of Ubuntu/Linux, installation of tools, terminal, SSH keys, aliases, paths etc 
Use of Intellij (shortcuts, configure servers, debug),
 cloud deploy, ssh, sql/tomcat setup
 Tools - Tomcat, Squirrel
 Technologies - Java, JDBC, Spring, Hibernate, AngularJS, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and the list goes on
Close to impossible (In terms of time consumed) to mentor the developers on each and every aspect 

Types of developers
hiring becomes critical in such cases especially if you are a startup. 
hire who either have some experience doing even the tiniest side projects 
or someone who has utmost willingness to learn and positive attitude

Taking charge
of own career cant depend on someone else
also its big words, but not like going to war,
its just about trying harder, longer.. though ofcourse not get too frustrated (which happens way too often in development we all have been through it)

Parenting 
keep giving instructions do this do that... 
they become woefully dependent on you
dont make them spoil for choice (we did not have these infinite training materials, we learnt from google, stackoverflow, documentation and trial and error)
this is exactly how parents sound
you have to give them goals, show them documentation/tutorials, and tell them to accomplish
guide... do not micromanage
lead by example... you should be ideal to mimic not a troubleshooter for every little thing
safe place ...when stcuk inspite of trying then they should feel safe to come to you... otherwise it can have negative impact
they feel bogged down with nowhere to go.
