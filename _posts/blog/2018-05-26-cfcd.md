I passed [Cloud Foundry Certified Developer](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/certification/) exam few weeks back. 

I am a big fan of Cloud Foundry. Its an excellent platform where things like scaling, deployment, and managing
cloud native applications is extremely easy. 

Its been a wonderful experience getting certified since I got to know about lot of CF's hidden gems and its internal workings. 

I am not allowed to disclose any information about the exam itself, but here are the official links that might be 
helpful if you are attempting the exam. 

- [Cloud Foundry Documentation](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/)
- [Official Certification Handbook](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/CFFCertCandidateHandbook.pdf) 
- [Offical Exam Rubric](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CFCD-Exam-Rubric.pdf)
- [Cloud Foundry Summit 2018 videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhuMOCWn4P9hJD3wsstF8gJIxOnJ_CTot)
- [Cloud Foundry Summit 2017 videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhuMOCWn4P9hTlDEWJZV8JbVsW01avHF1)

You can practice on any of the [certified cloud foundry providers](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/certified-platforms/). I practiced on [Pivotal](https://pivotal.io/platform) platform. 

Good luck!
