[Google Developer Days](https://developers.google.com/events/gdd-india/) was held for the first time in India. It was also my first ever event/conference.

### Event Management

Kudos to a very well managed event. Shuttles for pickups and drops, huge rooms for talks, ample comfortable seating areas with beanbags, wonderful catering.. it was extremely well thought-out. 
The Google staff was courteous and extremely helpful throughout the 2 days. 
Entire event was very smooth and yet highly energetic, despite being attended by probably a 1000 developers.

### Talks

There were [3 tracks](https://developers.google.com/events/gdd-india/schedule/day1) for talks and trainings over 2 days 

Here are the ones I attended 

- [Mobile in Context: Design Principle of Flow and Navigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZRczPw1BBw&index=24&list=PLlyCyjh2pUe_Xyqy9K6sBxwr0L8QaU7dq) by Jenny Gove. First of the 2 best talks for me. It had no fluff; only great examples, screenshots, stats and guidelines. 
- [Lighthouse, Headless Chrome, and Puppeteer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEw_n_wsk1o) by Eric Bidelman and Vinamrata Singal. Second of the 2 best talks for me. Amazing amount of detail; code-snippets, screenshots, tips and much-more compressed in a 30 minute session.
- [Running in the Background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciXFnhsI0R0&index=26&list=PLlyCyjh2pUe_Xyqy9K6sBxwr0L8QaU7dq) by Nasir Khan. This talk was about running Android tasks in the background. 
- [Actionable Insights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecWu8s5nIhY) by Amrit Sanjeev. This talk was about Firebase Prediction tools announced earlier this year. 
- [Testing out Kotlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER9L6Gg3HrE&t=4s) by Sean McQuillan. Unfortunately, this required advanced Kotlin knowledge which I don't have. 
- Building Production IoT Devices with Android Things by Wayne Piekarski. 

Many of the talks were live streamed and are available to watch on [Google Developers India Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlyCyjh2pUe_Xyqy9K6sBxwr0L8QaU7dq) 

I missed a few which I was looking forward to:

- Cloud Functions
- Design thinking workshop by Stanford
- Hands-on with the Google Cloud Vision and Natural Language APIs

### Training
I could only attend one training - 'Build a Web App with Firebase and Cloud Firestore' led by Arthur Thompson. 
We live-coded [a Restaurant listing web-app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firestore-web/#0). 

### Sandboxes
This was one of the more popular areas of the conference. Lot of small booths showcasing Google's products. 

- Here I got to know about [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) an Google Chrome extension which provides feedback on the websites. 
- Saw couple of cool demos made with [Android things](https://developer.android.com/things/index.html)
- Gave feedback to Firebase team about incremental commit-sync for static hosting
- Saw GCP's Video Intelligence API demos. Was awesome. 
- Pluralsight promotion (offered 2 months free subscription for those who complete a small Android IQ test)

### Codelabs
There was a dedicated section with workstations to try out [all the code-labs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/) available for Google platforms. 
Googlers were available to help resolve any issues. 
I wish I had done couple of them at the event. Well, maybe next time. 

### Community Lounge
Lot of lightning-talks were held at the community lounge randing from 'Solve for India' to 'Networking Skills'. 
There was also a dedicated track for 'Mobile and Web Design'.

### Swag
Every developer at the event got an Android Things [Pico pro maker kit](https://developer.android.com/things/hardware/imx7d-kit.html). Can't wait to get hacking away at this.

### Feedback 

- Great Google/event staff. Everyone was courteous and extremely helpful. Zero hiccups. keep going!   
- Talks by [Jenny Gove](https://twitter.com/jennylg) and [Eric Bildeman](https://twitter.com/ebidel) were perfect templates. Lot of in-depth technical details, examples and stats. I wish more talks were like these.   
- Some talks should have been split between beginners and advanced. 
For example: talk about Kubernetes was neither a good introduction nor in-depth architecture overview. 
No qualms against the host though, as 30 minutes is too short for a Kubernetes scale subject. 
- Get view of attendance's interest beforehand with a online poll and assign rooms accordingly. 

### Conclusion

Overall it was a wonderful event! Well managed, lot of talks, insightful discussions, meeting fellow developers and lot more. 

Thank you all at Google for inviting me and hosting a wonderful conference!
