excerpt: About Roger Federer, after his loss at Wimbledon 2008  
---

I recently found this long lost article about Roger Federer's loss to Rafael Nadal in Wimbledon Open 2008. Being a fan myself, I found it mirroring my feelings.

The article is not written by me. I couldn't find the link to the original.

Nothing's Changed  
by Homer E. Mendoza   
July 6, 2008   

I don’t know how much longer I’ll have to wait until Federer finally solves Nadal, the way he’s solved Lleyton Hewitt, or arguably, David Nalbandian. I don’t know how much longer until he gets out of this funk he’s been in since the beginning of the year. I don’t know what this loss will do to his confidence, and his legacy. Because as much as I am hurting, I can’t even begin to imagine how Federer must feel. His genius is so perceptive, so sensitive to what is going on around him, that the same intelligent awareness that allows him to play such other-worldly tennis could also hurt him so much more, make him feel so much more pain, and make the proverbial agony of defeat so much more excruciating. So even though I cheered for and wept with him, along with every one of his fans around the world, for every winner and unforced error he made in this match, only he, only Roger, can truly know what this moment means. Only he, save the Immortal, knows the answers. 

So I will wait, and pray, and hope, and believe. For this is the only thing I can do. I will do this for as long as it takes, through every loss, and every win. Because regardless of whatever changes, one thing stays the same. Roger Federer is the only tennis player I have ever seen that can inspire me with such ecstasy, such agony, such a profound depth of feeling that makes even defeat seem heroic, and paints so bitter a loss in such a beautiful light. 

Never have I been so disappointed, as I was today. Never have I been so proud! For that, I owe him my loyalty

I love Federer for his talent and sublime elegant skills. I love him for his dedication, commitment and never-give-up attitude. I love him for his honesty in the interviews. I love him for being humble and a family person. I love him for showing immense respect to his peers, his sport and its tradition. 

It was heart wrenching to see Federer crying. The very fact that after rewriting the records books, a loss still hurt him this much. I also had new found respect for Rafael Nadal for consoling Federer. Here are legends at top of their game, arguably the best, tennis has ever seen, showing the sportsman spirit tennis deserves.
