(When people say why do you need any regulation, let there be open markets. This is why. Even with regulation these corporations will go to unethical lengths to gain revenue. )

The result is simple: with no theory, the produced code is practically useless. In Naur’s terms, such a program is dead; in our case, it’s stillborn. Every time one generates code by prompt, they create a new stillborn program; vibe coding is the art of stitching together their corpses into Frankenstein’s monster.

## State of plans for 2025

# Plans for 2026

In 1971 Lewis Powell came out with a memo about how big business should take over the US government (Powell did not uses those exact words but it was clear to the wealthy what he meant).  Later that year Powell was put on the Supreme Court (this began the rise of many of the right wing think tanks like The Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society).  In 1978 the Republican majority on the Supreme Court ruled that businesses could start contributing to elections (First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti).  In 1980 Reagan was elected and changed the internal economic policy of the US from a Keynesian economics (Social Democracy) to Neoliberalism (Trickle-down economics).  Since that time the national debt has exploded, an estimated $60 trillion has flowed from the lower 90% to the top 10% of the population, the average working citizen has NOT gotten a raise over inflation in more than 40 years, and income inequality is at an all-time high.  Lastly, a 2014 Princeton University study found that the US in now an Oligarchy and no longer a democracy.  For those that are wondering about the media in the US, the media here is owned by the wealthy and large corporations and they set the narrative.  The US used to have a law called the Fairness Doctrine that kept propaganda to a minimum but that was repealed during the Reagan administration.  Propaganda is widespread in the US now, most of it right wing.  The only news outlets that are publishing anywhere close to the truth are ones that are publicly funded and two of those handful of outlets are soon to be defunded by the government because Trump and the Republicans don’t like that they tell the truth.  Look at democracies throughout history and how they fall.  Overwhelmingly, they fall when the wealthy take power of the government against the will of the people.  In most of those cases a figurehead is put in power (a dictator if you will) that does the biding of the wealthy.  This is what has happened in the US.
