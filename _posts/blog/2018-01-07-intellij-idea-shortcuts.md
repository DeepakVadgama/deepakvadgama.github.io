I absolutely love working with Intellij IDEA. I switched from Eclipse to Intellij ~4 years ago and have never looked back. Its fast, smart and a boon for productivity. I endorse it profusely to my team (as if I am being paid money for it; I don't). Yes, they all tease me about it :) 

I have created few videos of my most frequently used shortcuts. Hope it helps you.

### Conclusion

That's it. Learning about only ~80 shortcuts will help you code much much faster and you will hardly have to use the mouse. 

Start slow, maybe with 5 or 10 shortcuts and ramp up from there. If you forget a shortcut, use Ctrl + Shift + A to open `Action` window and type in your command instead of using the mouse. 

Slowly they all become muscle memory. I promise.

Happy coding!
