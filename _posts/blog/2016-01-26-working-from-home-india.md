Being a freelancer and working from home in India turned out to be different than I anticipated, primarily due to 
  
 * Budget - I don't earn enough to splurge on a [$1000 chair](http://store.hermanmiller.com/Products/Aeron-Chair) or a [triple monitor setup](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S4RfkcM1Dx8/maxresdefault.jpg)
 * Equipment Availability - 80% of equipment worth buying is not available in India.
 * India is diverse - Where I stay (Mumbai suburbs), electricity is a not an omnipresent entity (yeah, tell me about it). 

After months of tweaking, I settled on following setup:

### Desk

I found only [one](http://www.primaplastics.com/images/product-trolleys/trolleys_computer_big.png) in India fitting my needs. It is cheap (2,000 INR) and narrow (helps with my limited bedroom space). More importantly, it has keyboard deck much lower than monitor base (ergonomically correct). I still had to use books to further increase this distance.

One I have: [Prima Plastics](http://www.primaplastics.com/images/product-trolleys/trolleys_computer_big.png) (Not available online)    

### Chair
I cannot understate importance of getting this right. I started experiencing lower back pain within few weeks. These injuries are recurrent and can last decades. 

+ Ensure good lower back support. I use an extra cushion for this. 
+ Chair height and keyboard placement should allow shoulders to be in relaxed state.
+ Ensure chair is at good height such legs are not pressing too much against the chair cushion (that cuts off the blood flow). 
+ Checkout [this image](http://deepakvadgama.com/images/ergonomics.jpg) for ergonomics.  

Budget option: Similar to [this](http://www.pepperfry.com/ergonomic-chairs-by-emperor-1104811.html)  
The best: [Aeron](http://store.hermanmiller.com/Products/Aeron-Chair)

### Monitor

+ Opt for a monitor with matte display, it reduces the glare. The colors are not as bright as glossy screens, but hey, for a developer it shouldn't matter. 
+ IPS displays are better than TFT displays for color reproduction.
+ LED backlight helps save on electricity costs. 
+ Opt for at least 1080p resolution if budget allows.  
+ Keep the brightness and contrast to appropriate levels. Mine is 25% brightness and 50% contrast. Out of the box default values are much higher.
+ Ensure appropriate monitor height matching eye level. I use good old books for the same. *Update:* Not anymore, see next point.
+ Consider mounting the monitor on the wall with adjustable arms. *Update:* I recently got [one](http://www.amazon.in/CNCT-Displays-genuine-Product-picture/dp/B00N6PH6GW/). Turned out to be cheap yet rock solid. 

Budget option: [Dell E1916H](http://www.flipkart.com/dell-18-5-inch-led-e1916h-monitor/p/itmeazguwfsp5htv) with [CNT Wall mount](http://www.amazon.in/CNCT-Displays-genuine-Product-picture/dp/B00N6PH6GW/)    
The best: [Dell UltraSharp series](http://www.amazon.in/Dell-UltraSharp-U2412M-24-inch-Monitor/dp/B009X6FFSY?tag=googinhydr18418-21) with [Ergotron desk mount](http://www.amazon.com/LX-Desk-Mount-LCD-Arm/dp/B00358RIRC) 

### Mouse

I started developing wrist pain due to sideways movements. I bought this vertical mouse, and though its not perfect, it helped a lot to alleviate the pain.
  
Budget option: [Circle Sniper](http://www.amazon.in/Circle-Sniper-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B00EZONAA4), [Mousepad](http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00GA2EWM4)  
The best: [Evoluent Vertical Mouse](http://www.amazon.in/Evoluent-Vertical-Mouse-V4-Right/dp/B00427TAIK)

### Keyboard

I have a split keyboard, though expensive, has been serving me well for years now. Thus, I am not aware of a good budget keyboard. I'd suggest ones with soft keys and a good wristpad.  

One I have: [Kinesys Freestyle 2](http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-for-pc-us/), [Wristpad](http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B0013CF4FK)  
The best: [Das keyboard 4](http://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-professional/)

### Webcam

There is not much to the webcams. They are cheap and they do their job well.

Budget: [Logitech C310](http://www.flipkart.com/logitech-c310-hd-webcam/p/itmczzccgktpvkjy)  
Better: [Logitech C920](http://www.flipkart.com/logitech-hd-pro-c920/p/itmd7q5vnyvq7g6f)

## Lighting conditions

Blue light [disturbs sleep cycles](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side) and complete darkness hurts the eyes. I follow these rules to maintain the right luminosity:
  
* Day times: Keep windows open to let surrounding (halo) light in. It should not hit the monitor directly though (to avoid glare).
* Night times: Use a warm-white bulb/tube light (I use [this one](http://www.flipkart.com/philips-9-5-w-led-b22-3000k-a55-ind-bulb/p/itmef3hhfzfzf2vn)). Opt for LED bulb with 3000k to 4000k temperature rating. 
* Monitor lights: Use [redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) or [flux](https://justgetflux.com/) to limit amount of blue light monitor emits during night times.  
* Android phone: Similar [software for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.lumen&hl=en) in case, like me, you browse in bed at night.

These might sound like overkill, but I experienced stark difference with and without them. Also, overall costs for all above points is less than 400 INR.

## Connectivity

I stay in Mumbai suburbs where electricity is off for few hours a week.
 
* SMPS - Critical to get good quality SMPS for your Desktop. Low/high voltage can wreck all components. I have [Seasonic S12II](http://www.flipkart.com/seasonic-s12ii-430-watts-psu/p/itmd5xz5bzevdbzp).
* UPS - Good UPS can give you 3-5 hours of backup. Not many options in India though - [APC](http://www.amazon.in/APC-UPS-Model-BR1000G-IN-Battery/dp/B0038ZTZ3W) and [extra-battery](http://www.amazon.in/APC-BR24BPG-Back-UPS-External-Battery/dp/B0047E5B90).
* Internet - Hook up router to your UPS to ensure uninterrupted internet connectivity. Worst case use Smartphone 3G [hotspot](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/2812516?hl=en).
* Laptop - I have a laptop (my backup device) for just-in-case situations. Also helps when meeting clients.

Hope this helps. Comment below if you need any help/advice. 

Happy working from home!

Remember, wish is different than reality, and that is okay :)
