Massive learning. I have learned more in last 2 months about Spring than in last 10 years!
I am very excited to share my findings. I hope there are a couple of new things in this article for you too.

TODO: Create this table at the top, then start the lengthy article.

Spring Env:
- Profiles
- Flyway
- Default - Embedded tomcat, Logging,

Architecture:
- DTO Mappers
- Logging
- Spring auto constructor inject (good for testing)


Spring Security
- Spring User vs Custom User
- Auth with CSRF, CORS, CSP, X-Auth-Token etc built-in
- Encoding passwords - BCrypt
- URL based security
- Method based security
- Update hasAuthority from Role to fine-grained Permissions (custom)
- @CurrentUser (same as AuthenticationPrincipal)

Controllers:
- Exception handling (Controller Advices)
- DTO Validation
- JSON Conversions (@JSONIgnore)


JPA / Hibernate
- ID generation (types)
- JPA Repository
- Transactional (w/ readyonly)
- Version (for optimistic locking)
- Validation
- Date time, Duration java 8
- CreatedBy, ModifiedBy
- Auditing (w/ Revision repo)
