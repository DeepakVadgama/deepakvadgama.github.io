excerpt: Why we, as a civilization, are becoming more polarized in our opinions?

In last few years there has been a tidal wave of polarization sweeping the world. 
Once you start to look for the patterns, you'll find them everywhere.  

### Movies
All the blockbuster movies of modern era seem to be about good vs evil. Take examples of Avengers, Avatar, Dark Knight, Man Of Steel; the list goes on 
and on. There is no conflict within, there are no personal sacrifices, there are no decisions to be made. Only factions to be formed and to have one faction
kill and get praised by the world, or be killed and be called a martyr. This plague has swept most of the biggest franchises of Hollywood. 
The rationale for this is simple: dumb down the movie enough to reach widest audience base possible (primarily non-english speaking population).
In fact even the process of movie-making as an art-form itself has been compromised by these money making machines (watch [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting/videos?shelf_id=1&sort=p&view=0) to see what I mean).

I wonder what the psychological impact this has on children (especially combined with the social pressure of competing and expectation of being the best at everything).   

### Politics

Destin Sandlin [YouTube channel: Smarter-Everyday](https://youtu.be/Tjl8ka3F6QU?t=21m54s) in a conversation with President Barack Obama discussed issue of polarization in Politics. 
 Obama's answer was simple and rational: (paraphrased) When people just depend on single source of news which itself might have certain bias, that biased information becomes their belief. 
 This is even supported by statistic in Destin's [subsequent video](https://youtu.be/GpWQHFzrEqc?t=4m22s)

### Twitter and YouTube comments 
  
I think technology is one of the primary reasons of this polarization. Every person on the planet has a voice; they just need to choose the platform to express themselves. 
 It could be Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, WhatsApp, WeChat you name it. 
 I am no psychologist, but maybe, the more people express themselves finding like-minded individuals along the way, more reinforced their beliefs become creating a vicious cycle. 
 This many a times changes their tone of subsequent voice even more aggressive. 
 Anonymity of the internet adds fuel to the fire. No where is this phenomenon more apparent than YouTube comments. 
 There is even a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zxy_dScjsM) explaining why these comments are generally so harsh and negative.


### India's intolerance debate
Recently India had a massive hoopla about [intolerance](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/04/opinions/agrawal-tolerance-india/).
 It all started with couple of small issues but soon exploded with everyone from celebrities, actors, politicians, twitterati, everyone weighing in.
 Most of these comments followed the pattern. Choose your faction and bombard the enemy. 
Though the ruling government is accused for these incidents, perceived to be caused by intolerance; the reality I think, is quite murky.


### Transparency of information

Nassim Nicholas Taleb said it very aptly in a recent [interview](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/narendra-modi-is-an-ascetic-he-hasnt-disappointed-nassim-nicholas-taleb/articleshow/50813198.cms)

> Let me tell you how Twitter has changed our world. In the past you guys — the newspaper business — could control information. All I had to do was take over your paper and then we can hide any information we want. Even in democracies and especially in the United States. Today, thanks to Twitter, citizen journalism is making the world much more transparent. What happened is (because of that) people have an illusion of the world becoming more corrupt when all we are getting is more reporting. There is a huge perception of governance that comes with it. 


### Road from here

Of course, the solution to this cannot be regulation or blocking of this 'freedom of expression'. 
That goes against the inherent nature of internet, which is its openness and a level playing field. 
Instead, we as a collective group need to realize the importance of understanding both sides of the coin before jump-starting debates. 
An informed, measured approach is always preferable over brash, sudden actions. As a friend of mine likes to say *"It doesn't take much to ruin things.."* 

Journalism comes with responsibility: unbiased reporting which is still passionate enough to bring forth issues being neglected. 
I think citizen journalism from the universe of Twitter to multitude of comment systems need to shoulder similar responsibility.
