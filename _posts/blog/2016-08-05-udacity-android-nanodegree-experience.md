## TLDR;
- Enroll if you need little push and have ample time to work on the course projects.
- If you are a self starter or working part time, you can learn Android using all same courses, sans the certificate.
- Udacity's career resources are very good.

## My time line
Today I graduated Udacity's Android Nanodegree. It took me 13 months (average is 9-12 months). 
I was working full-time while doing the course causing the delays in completion.
I am sad that I missed out on 50% tuition discount (applicable for finishing course within 12 months). Anyways.

## Video lessons
The video lessons for the course are excellent. They are created (mostly) by Googler from Android team. 
The concepts are explained with clear code examples, charts, and sprinkle or humor. 
The lessons are split into very tiny sections. 
In each section, a concept is explained, implemented by coding and you are asked to code side-by-side.
This really helps a lot! 
The lessons are of top notch quality and cover entire gamut of Android landscape.    

## Projects
Course requires you to complete these 9 projects:

- P0: Static android app, just to ensure Android development environment is setup correctly. [Very Easy]
- P1: Basic app to create project structure and understand activity life cycle. [Medium]
- P2: Advanced app to implement ContentProvider, Loaders, SyncAdapter, Services etc. If you survive this, you will complete entire Nanodegree. So hang in there. [Hard]
- P3: App to address corner cases, implement design elements and use Google Cloud Messaging. [Medium]
- P4: App to understand advanced usage of gradle. [Easy] 
- P5: App to implement Material design. [Medium]
- P6: App for Android Wear. [Medium]
- P7: Planning for final Capstone project. [Easy]
- P8: Final capstone project. [Hard/Time-consuming]

I found the P2, P6 and P8 to be the most time-consuming. I suspect most Nanodegree students who left the course must have done it in P2. 
Thus, they had to start Basics Nanodegree so that students don't get overwhelmed. 
As per the reviews, the reviewers are generally very quick to review the projects.   

## Webcasts/Forums/Slack

- Communication - Udacity will send you emails around project deadlines. Other than that, entire nanodegree is self done, and thus can feel lonely. I think Udacity can improve in this area.
- Discussion forums - One of the best resources to resolve project specific issues. Mentors are very quick to response and community is very helpful. 
- Ability to schedule one-on-one discussions with Udacity mentor to solve issues. I never used this.  
- Webcasts - There were lot of webcasts at beginning explaining various libraries and such. Though lately, these are not very frequent. 

I think last year when Nanodegree programs had just started Udacity was more personally involved and was prompt in taking feedback. 
Now that they've scaled, most the communication is left to the site/community, and self-motivation of the students.

## Android development
Learning Android itself was a bumpy train ride. Android is quite extensive and some times overwhelming. 
It has to be learnt one step at a time. 
I made [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Oabu4mzMVP2odS5AWgFq68kc6Xi4Zt4wvy6NPlMjfFU/edit?usp=sharing) during the whole course. 
Also, I had to rely a lot on StackOverflow and sample Github code to complete the projects.

## Career guide
The career resources of Udacity are excellent. 
There are lot of articles about Careers, Finding Jobs, Writing Cover Letters, Interview preparation etc. 
Also, there are reviews done of your Resume, Github/Linked-In profiles, 
Udacity itself has recruiters on the platform. 
I have updated my profile though I have not received any interest from any company.

## Certificate value
Udacity showcases profiles of students who have received jobs after completing the course.  
Though, there are no statistics about what percentage of students get placed and with what average salary. 
Thus, certificate value is big open question still. 
I have just finished the course, and I'm planning to apply for jobs later this month. 
Will update this post on any related news.

## Final Thoughts 
In hindsight, I spent way too much money for this certificate (13*$200). 
Though, if I hadn't had the pressure of those monthly-payments, I wouldn't have been so keen to finish the course. 
So I am happy to have done it. Now, eagerly awaiting the Google Cloud Nanodegree to launch.
