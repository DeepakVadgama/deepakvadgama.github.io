Reason
- Looks - beauty in 1 lac dress, and inch makeup. banged by corporate advertisements, movies, tv shows and other weddings
        while it is in elegance, grace, your conduct, your flow, your ease, your confidence, way you carry yourself
         
- husband - I too these days buy sherwanis costing 1L which in many cases are bought by girl's parents. 
and i will collect all my friends and have alchohol, because consuming substance that makes you loose control of yourself is awesome and hip. 
         
- family - place in soceity shown by money (not paying a dime by themselves but asking female's parents to do it, 
showing cars, real estate and money as power and place in society, 3000/- rupee ka thali

- comedy of bringing showpeice to house (buying frmo market not by giving money but taking dowry), 
showing her off to the town, giving her a list of things to do and not do
making sure she remains within the boundaries... ensure she does seva, not out of love but out of obligations. 
Its her duty to consider them as her parents, same goes for the husband, though acceptance might come late, but love is to give

- rituals - veds mantras, brahma's daughter, speed up 2.5x so that DJ can happen, will drink during DJ, mantras are from eternity so they will 
ensure marriage bond remains inspite of your ego and unwillingness to adjust, concept of divorce picking steam in indian soceity even 
 though same rituals were observed during your parents' wedding... and also God does not understand simple english, or hindi..
 She only speaks language of the mantras and sanskrit, all you want is Her blessings and you cannot ask that yourself.
 
- rituals2: pheres meaning, fasting because that helps enhance your marriage longetivity, sit first on the chair and for whole
life, i repeat whole life you will have upperhand over your spouse, wow so much power! Why not just push spouse off the stage
and be the first. 

Whisper of the closed relatives giving advice, because marriage is so easy that all it takes is few words of advice.

- female's parents - crushed under the weight of societal expectations of giving girl gold, and lot of other things as dowry,
absorbing abuses in the vieled form of *tana*, watching a daughter leave
         
- relatives attend - tick mark on attendance, and we are so happy being here that 
 we will immediately have lunch as soon as wedding starts, do some gossip, give money as shagun, and get the hell out of here
 complaint about travelling so far, find some minor issue and blow it up. Haters always hate, and well wishers always adjust and 
 make the best of it.
