Sometimes matters of heart start with ecstasy and end in agony...   
World makes no sense amidst the chaos, until you have an epiphany


I woke up, eyes dazed, utterly confused...  
Something was different, for a few seconds I remained unmoved 


With birds chirping, the day seemed so bright...  
Unlike last 2 weeks, my chest didn't feel that tight 


I danced and sang the tunes of my choice...  
The day was liberating, I finally found my voice 


I found myself in a mirror, uninhibited, unchained...  
With long lost dimpled smile, welcome back Deepak, I exclaimed 


May be it's not about vindication, it's about self discovery...  
Like a person long lost on an island, to have gazed upon a ferry 


I even talked to my deserted friend, my current nickname for her is prego..  
Our friendship just keeps adding up, akin to the blocks of Lego 


For most, happiness is about getting drunk and acting wild...  
For me, it's being oblivious to the pain like a giggling child 


So far I have come in last few weeks, it is beyond belief...  
Here I thought when the worst is over, all you feel is just relief 


Leap ahead, push the boundaries, I screamed...  
Scale the walls of success, your heroics will be beamed 


Like a thunderbolt erupting from dark clouds I will emerge...   
This phase of life will always be remembered as my surge


@Gaya  
You bring calm and logic wherever you go, be it a fun party or a situation dire...  
Rare are people like you; I would want you to be with me if the world is ever on fire


@Mau
Absorb every bit of the closeness with friends before you embark on a wonderful journey of marriage...  
For the beautiful, talented and joyful person you are, you deserve nothing less than being treated like a royal, including with the carriage 


@Poem-inspirer  
If things go south, don't be afraid, there is always a dawn...  
Reach out to me, there is still a page left in the book for our swan-song
