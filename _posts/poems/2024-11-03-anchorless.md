excerpt: Destitute soul, nourished by moments
---

Destitute soul, nourished by moments  
Ordinary yet feeding, inconspicuous affections  
Innocuous laughs, frustrating rituals  
Molded into memory, heartfelt connections  
  
Experiences, insignificant, mundane  
Made joyous, in passage of time  
Made painful, its inevitable march  
Paralyzing, its power divine  
  
Bonds perceived, misconstrued in innocence  
Held irrevocably, only if interknit, received  
Self deception, a love lopsided  
Temporary play, allowed, appeased  
  
Fresh wounds, inhibit retrospection  
Incessant pings, bouncing in gray  
Activating memories, an existential dread  
Tucked safely then, now laid bare and fray  
  
The chain unlinked  
Soul drifts through the unbound  
Floats aimlessly  
Unknown, pained, confound  
  
Countless beings, countless interactions  
Shallow and futile, soul remains astray  
Reaching out over and over  
Ghost off-plane, trying to convey  
  
Stare out the window, marvel at the infinite  
Stars and light, intense and exhaustive  
Holding all the answers  
A hope, a spark, a pull deceptive  
  
Amongst the stars, all I see is dark  
Devoid of life, devoid of meaning  
Ever expanding nothingness, a vacuum  
Past bonds, too distant for my keening  
  
Tears don't relieve  
Words left unseeded  
The tightness stays  
Unsolicited, unheeded  
  
Saints preach  
Solitary soul  
Cut ties of the self  
Raise towards One goal  
  
Her nudge, a final hope  
Turn-around a life remiss  
Only faith left, for distressed thread  
Forestalling a fall into the abyss
