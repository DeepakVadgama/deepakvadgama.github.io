Hi buddy, how's life, she said..   
Hey girl, long time no see, he said 

Let me tell you about this wonderful guy I met recently..   
I met a girl too, only if we shared bit more frequently 

He is strong, stable, like a pillar..   
She has a heart of gold, her looks are killer 

He is feared; lot of respect he commands..   
She is ferocious when situation demands 

He is like a lion, the king of the jungle..   
She belongs to the sky, a star with a twinkle 

He cheers me up every time I am sad..  
Her company itself suffices for me, I feel so glad 

He picks up the slack when I leave some..   
She encourages me to push myself like I've never done 

He thinks clearly, his decisions are based on logic and sense..   
She gets so many things done, yet it never gets tense 

His stories are engrossing, we are sometimes up until five..   
She debates with me constantly, it's never boring, things are always alive 

He is so attune to my feelings, always listening, always interested..   
She is cheerful, bubbly, wild, completely uninhibited

I'm in love, it all worked out, I'm marrying my stud soon..   
It didn't for me, I'll keep looking, in daylight and under the moon 

It was great talking to you, good luck, she said..   
Ditto, my lady, until we meet again, he said
