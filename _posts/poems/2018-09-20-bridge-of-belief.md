excerpt: In self, or someone else
---

In self  
Or someone else  
In karma  
Or the Divine  
  
Prerequisites experiences galore  
Intimate knowledge afore  
Constant trials before  
Cycles of turning back and more  
  
Proportional to the misgiving  
Crossing the chasm, often unforgiving  
Mandates deep sacrifice  
Such hardship, denouncing own vice  
  
Innocence carries such weight  
Rationals call it blind faith  
Road paved with much queer  
Held back by logic and fear  
  
The bridge to infinite wonder, ariel  
Tethered to the ground, material  
Not even dimly visible  
Seemingly barely credible  
  
Only vibrations of evidence  
Teachings of guides, the only providence  
Eons of battles, fought hard  
Just to discover head of the path  
  
Be meticulous, it's not a spree  
Take your time, judge not thee  
Hand over the key  
Forget the “me”
