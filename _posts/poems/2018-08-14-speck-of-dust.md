excerpt: A speck of dust, born and died
---

A speck of dust  
Was born and died  
A moment in time  
Subliminal for the universe  
An ageless tide  

Born pure  
Molded with fear  
Grew resentful  
Forgotten mere  

Unreasonable demands  
Unflinching, with no abort   
A far reaching vision     
always falling short  

A deadline slipped  
An event missed  
A conversation that hit  
Purity chipped, each bit  

Confined himself  
In place and time  
The frog in a well  
Drew the line  

Power and wealth   
As if elixir divine  
A ladder too high  
Of suffering & crime  

A journey inward  
Or the limitless outward  
Either, is the purpose  
Not this circus  

A prayer modest  
To break confine  
Reach the bar  
Set by the divine
