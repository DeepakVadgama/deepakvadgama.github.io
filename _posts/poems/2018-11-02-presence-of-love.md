excerpt: Often, I wonder
---

Often, I wonder  
If there can be love without tears  
  
Tears not of pain.. but  
Of pure joy  
Of your heart giving in  
Of ego accepting defeat  
Of soul declaring surrender  
  
Often, I wonder  
If the literature of love is real  
  
Unconditional.. demanding  
Of only attention  
Of no special qualities  
Of no hard earned knowledge  
Of no right of passage  
  
Often, I wonder  
If intensity of love can be measured  
  
Naive interactions..  
Of hand holding  
Of infectious smiles  
Of innocent questions  
Of call outs for the beloved  
  
Often, I wonder  
If everyone experiences love  
  
Of being lost in its purity  
Of a feeling overwhelming  
Of dim realization in hindsight  
Of an experience allowed to partake  
  
Often, I wonder  
If such love can be repaid  
  
There isn’t enough..  
Of material value to match  
Of love in my tiny heart  
Of gratitude to go around  
Of authority over you, to work around  
  
Often, I wonder  
If she isn’t you, yourself, Radhe
