excerpt: They pity the fool
---

They pity the fool    
They saw him in despair   
Help him at once, for we’re wiser   
Our belief, we must share   
   
Tie the knot, they said   
With someone who cares   
Its established, this world   
Is only made for pairs   
   
Stop the vigilance, tending   
they continued, the caloric quantity   
Being thin, a sign of the weak   
Hazardous even, an unfit personality   
   
Buy a home, a car   
They’re a life’s measure    
Portray the success   
Convert your treasure   
   
Go out, mingle   
Don’t bear, belong, at the party   
Being alone amongst billions   
Doesn’t fit; its out of place, tardy   
   
For happiness that alludes me,    
they’ve attained, I presume   
The secret I yearned for   
they’ve unlocked, I assume   
   
They care, they try, constantly   
For the fool, to attain a joyful life   
End the friction between us sects   
They call for an end to this strife   
   
O’ world, said the fool    
I am grateful, for unearned   
your compassion, the grants   
I empathize, your helpless struggle   

For the price to evolve  
to conform, is too high  
Breaking free, harder even  
She continues the try
   
I am no fool, mind you    
Its worse, arrogant, dumb   
Being lured into innocence   
Waiting lifetimes to succumb
