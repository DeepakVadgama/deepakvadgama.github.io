excerpt: a pebble laid, in a garden of eden
---

a pebble laid, in a garden of eden  
teeming with movement & green  

self-aware, highly keen  
eternally inanimate, unseen  

motionless, longing for elation  
unceasingly, it wondered 'creation'   

fate arrived, in a playful mood  
euphoric, to have finally moved   

no agency, a fact rife  
yet quivering, with virgin life  

so many emotions, left it dazed  
towards the sky, feeling amazed  

reaching zenith, it came to rest  
moment of stillness, meditative crest   

strong belief, a dissonant theory  
the dull pain, a distant memory  

the joy of love  
the spark of life  

two stars circling, the dance & pull  
closer and closer, the bliss & swoon  

universe a remnant, the merge superior  
two lovers, ecstasy, wild & clear  

too naive, to realize own identity  
evanescent joy, mistaken for personality  

the downward fall, began to take  
a senseless hope, that its a fake  

acutely aware of blunder, began self pity  
even blind cannot be forgiven, for such credulity  

crashing back, to the grim reality   
shattering the dim illusion of sanity  

memories of zenith, stuck forever  
fueling fire of demise, ever and ever  

cruel it thought, to see a glimmer of hope  
then cast away, an unwanted trope   

incessant pain, repeatedly analyzed  
crying for release, lying paralyzed
