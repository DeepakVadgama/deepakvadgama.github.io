excerpt: Stream of memories, an endless flow
---

Stream of memories, an endless flow  
A constant tug, won't slack nor let go  
  
Vivid images, all consuming  
Relentless, unabashed, all subsuming  
  
Attempts at self-reliance, fervent yet fruitless   
Your love a drip, intravenous, ceaseless  
  
Dreams, I pray, a relief, virgin space  
Punishing instead, their torturous embrace  
  
Reliving moments, incessant, paralyzed  
Vivid, beyond reach, aching for the void  
  
Body awakes, but mind protests   
Day renews, but pain endures  
  
Blank stare, lying numb  
Heart racing, morning glum  
  
Time passes, a blare awaited  
Impetus impassive, firm, unmotivated   
  
Aimless movements, autonomic chores  
Bare minimum responsibilities, no growth  
  
Pings of pain, unwavering fears  
Yearning irrepressible, silent tears  
  
Urge to reach out, no one to abide  
To profess, to plead, nor confide  
  
Curtain of memories, blinding reality  
Stumbling through fog, hope for duality  
  
Cavalier over decades, the ego brewed   
Hardened, deftly crumbled by solitude  
  
Intolerable ache, no longer my own  
Anguish intense, impulse to disown  
  
Intensified connection, bodies apart  
Echoes of past, thaws the heart  
  
Delayed realization, my time with you  
Ecstacy in hindsight, eternal joy in few  
  
Emotional unison, our precious trove  
A lifeless soul, propped up by love  
  
Time stands still in your absence, my love  
I implore mercy O'Lord, deliver me from above  
  
Epilogue:  
Her gentle nudge to turn me about   
Her violent attempt to snap me out
