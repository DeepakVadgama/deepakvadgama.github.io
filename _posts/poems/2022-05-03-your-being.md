excerpt: Blades of morning grass
---

Blades of morning grass  
Swayed in fresh breeze  
The dew drops, the stream,  
The garden, the trees  
  
"Deepak", words rung  
They broke my reverie  
Awake or asleep this instant?  
A condition, so weary  
  
Sharp out of daze  
It was your smile   
Just your presence  
Enough to drift awhile  
  
You moved with abandon  
The skirt's twist & turn  
Elegance personified  
My quest to discern  
  
You stopped and stared  
Piercing deep brown eyes  
Intoxicating, the charm  
Hypnotic, frozen, effusive tries  
  
Your being inspires poetry  
Fervent, beauty divine  
Lips to embarrass a rose  
The moan to still even time  
  
Close as touch,  
Yet unreachable, a crest  
Each tick, a lifetime  
An indefinite test  
  
Such beauty, the urge  
To whisk you off your feet  
Or swoon over your elegance  
On my knees, entreat  
  
Unbounded love  
Winged but not yet wild  
Only smiles & glances  
Akin a helpless child  
  
Yhe agony, the confusion  
Punishment and bethrow  
'I deserve', an illusion  
Soul pleads, forgive & forgo  
  
Elusive, this rapture   
Embrace the flow  
For once, my love  
Just let go  
  
  
Epilogue:  
"Beauty in eyes of beholder",   
She said in kind  
With smile and a shake, I told her  
"The world is blind"
