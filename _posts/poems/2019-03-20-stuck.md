excerpt: Time has taken it's toll
---

Time has taken it's toll  
Inept in finding my role  
Attempts to bind myself in a whole  
Subsequent failures pecking at the soul  
  
Finding myself over the hill   
Life seems drifting still  
Unable to find my keel  
Blind, moving with just the feel  
  
Simmering visions of a made up desire  
Starts and chases haunted by failure  
Burned ceaselessly by my own ire  
Every positive intent halted by the listless fire  
  
Weight of fitting in a mould  
Crumbling under expectations old  
Artillery of friends and neighbors bold  
Heavier still of family and the tight hold  
  
Empathy, that I lately abide  
A relentless scam, a ruthless snide  
Unmirrored, I wish to change the side  
Or take the high road, avoid the fight  
  
Cultures vary, but this is distraught  
A two front war cannot be fought  
Safety net should be sought  
Breaking free, encouraged, taught
