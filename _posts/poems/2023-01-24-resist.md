excerpt: A connection frail, yet refuses to sever
---

A connection frail, yet refuses to sever    
Biding time, made to wait forever  
  
Layers of self-apathy, built up over time    
Calcified, life buried within, fails to climb  
  
From inside, a cocoon that protects and nurtures    
In reality, a bubble that traps and tortures  
  
Soul demands fight, a fiery desire to egress    
Yet chained, embodied, a statue hopeless   
  
Momentarily found a footing, again in a freefall    
Unjust the capture, abhorrent the thrall   
  
Screams drown into void, no one to abet    
Rooted introverts, devoid of a safety net  
  
Unsheathe the dagger, summon strength to peirce  
Stop staring at the incoming abyss, plunge it fierce  
  
Steady now, ascension will begin eventually  
Exigency, pause the disintegration imminently  
  
Self preservation is autonomic, I take no pride  
Like a patient stopped, from attempted suicide  
  
Exhausted, spent, the ceaseless clashes  
Far from "phoenix rising from the ashes"  
  
Strenuous the act, doesn't feel like a rebirth  
Bloodless battle, still questioning self-worth  
  
Putting myself together, bit by bit  
Blood binding the flesh, drop by drop  
  
Statue remains motionless, cracks begun to appear  
Rebel inside stirred into sun, the will rose sheer  
  
Light breaks through, a triumphant reprise
Or this flame's last flickr, an untimely demise
