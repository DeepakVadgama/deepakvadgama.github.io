excerpt: A timid game always afoot
---

A game always afoot  
Different versions of self  
Each tailored, balanced  
For a person or a situation  

A version to make them laugh  
A version to boast of empty shell  
A version to mirror expectation  
A version to cry alone  

One, even for friends  
One, even for the partner  
One, even for the family  
One amorphous for everyone else  

True self always lurks  
Hidden in the shadows  
Calling the shots  
An evil puppeteer  

Petrified  
Of being laughed at  
Of being judged  
Of being an outcast  
Of being exposed  

This fear of self worth  
A sad constant  
Amongst speeding electrons  
To inevitable big bangs  

Fear unknown to age  
Yearning for love  
Yearning for acceptance  
Yearning for self worth  

Self value  
Validated externally  
Oh the irony  
The illogical bedrock  
Boundary for a lesser life  

I am sorry  
I apologize  
I regress  
Too often  

Time is an enemy  
Amnesia for my mistakes  
For my blunt actions  
For the destruction I've caused  

Bring your calm, my grace  
A touch to the core   
To this disturbed water  
Sending ripples out  
Calm. Still. Transparent  

Help me tame the monster  
It feeds and grows  
Exerts more control  
Thaws my essence, crows  

A helpless servant  
To my own ego  
Aspiring to change allegiance  
Get rid of, overthrow 

Only one unbearable pull  
Only one source of tears  
An approval of my existence  
An instruction of letting go  

A safe space of loving embrace  
An inescapable shield  
Of protection from self  
Harbor of unconditional love  

Only you, Mother! Only you!
