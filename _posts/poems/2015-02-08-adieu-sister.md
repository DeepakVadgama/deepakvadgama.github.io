excerpt: I have a question for you, why are you called mau?

I have a question for you, why are you called mau?...  
Is the softness, or the ferocity, which one represents thou?


Edgy personalities appeal to me, my search for them, result in only a few...  
But if a girl asked me about a complete person, I would ask her to idolize you


I have a thousand compliments to pay, nothing in return to reap...  
They are not included in this write-up, to avoid coming off as a creep


Come march, the dry city awaits you...  
Made wholesome by outsiders like us; locals are good too


Alive the city feels, with infinite malls, exquisite food outlets and the hip crowd..  
But finding inner peace can be hard, even the soul will have to shout out loud


I picture you on a humongous vessel some day...  
Accompanying the vastness of the seas, far from the bay


Elbows propped, pondering over a book and may be thoughts of a poem to write...  
Missing your parents, and the musketeers, it will keep you awake into the night


Your better half will come to heal, uninstigated, you won’t even have to move...  
You will then share life stories and experiences, smiles they will bring through


God speed to both of you, hope your relationship surpasses synergy...  
I imagine even your fights will rhyme and inevitable make-ups would be like poetry


Thanks for helping me find my pen, I owe it all to you...  
I’m not even close to being a poet, but it feels nice to have written a few


We are like 2 travelers crossing path, exchanging stories across sparks of bonfire...  
Under the starry night, pushing away the threat of cold and darkness’s ire


I re-read this poem, dear Lord, it is too mushy...  
If your fiancé misconstrues, I’ll need to hide some place bushy


I've always lagged years behind my maturity, while you are the opposite bit...  
Forgive me if this sounds like advice, hope one day, you deem it fit


Don’t lose your identity sister, show resistance and fight hard...  
If lost, an impossible treasure hunt it will be, the mining equipment will fall short


Adieu I say too soon, considering next 30 days will be a frenzy...  
I wish for only one thing... May you find your calling sensei
