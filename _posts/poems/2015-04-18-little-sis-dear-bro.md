It took months of lul, for us to truly believe you've left forever...    
Usually I get by, unearthing memories of our times together

I wonder if we were typical siblings when young, with constant fighting and bickering...  
I regret our fights turning violent, but your revenge was fake tears with lips quivering

I guess we solidified the relationship during our college years...  
Conversing in hindi, sharing everything from love life to many of our fears

It's true what they say, the closest relationships are always taken for granted...    
It took me many years to realize, you were always the best sister anyone could've ever wanted

The first time you met Nimesh, you told me about how he seemed mild mannered and sweet...    
To this day I second that sentiment, in addition to him being always positive and upbeat

With wedding getting closer and closer, days flew by so quick, my memory of it all is a blur...    
You took all the decisions in your stride, then I realized how grown-up and mature you really were

Memories of the wedding, they give me shivers to this day; I wonder if the stress was worthwhile...    
Then I look at the pics of you two dancing and laughing together; and my stress turns into a smile

You looked like a real princess, standing tall with the free flowing grace...    
While he looked like an dignified aristocrat, with a smile and mischief on his face

The ceremony was so beautiful, with you two being the focus and all of its charm...    
The sweetest moment though, has to be during *vidai* when Nimesh hugged our mom

He is so sweet and caring; its evident that the characteristic is at his core...    
He is protective as he is loving; so much so, that we don’t worry about you anymore

You are moving towards far land with beautiful landscape and cleaner air...    
Success will follow you to the far east, once you’ve put in the effort and care

I know you are dying to visit the beaches and the australian wild...    
This is the age to live, love and laugh; embrace your inner child

Don’t look too far ahead, don’t waste energy living the past...    
Enjoy the companionship, live in the moment, and have a blast

You compliment each other in almost all aspects and that makes you stronger...    
Though, you both are too caring for this unfair world; steer clear of naive blunder

Relationships are about adjustments, compatibility & picking your battles...    
Foundation built solid as a rock, world might quake but nothing within rattles

Even for small mistakes, we might scold you in-person or on hangouts...    
You might have your own young ones, but for us you will forever remain tots

Be prepared to host us in the faraway land, with red carpet and the silverware...    
We want to see all there is, including crocs, kangaroos, and the koala bear

The second time we visit you, I picture my niece awaiting us at the gate...    
I wonder if the adorable doll will greet me as mama or just wave ‘hey mate’

Fly away my sweet birdies, soar and soar until you touch the sky...    
Your dreams are for the taking; nothing this world can now deny  
In a tight mesh of many connections, we are nodes always close by...    
Our book stays open, I’m only turning pages, not saying good-bye
