If someone asked me how much I earn; I'd say, less than I deserve but more than I need...    
At the end of the day, all that I should want is shelter, clothing and cute little piglets to feed


It's weird that most of us, including me, are infected with the virus of greed...  
Shouldn't we all strive for content, make it not our motto but also our creed?


Oh you HR managers, stop grinning; the logic is not without girth...    
Money is still the universal measuring tape for valuing a candidate's worth


Unlike convention, salary negotiations don't call for aggression...    
An ideal world would instead strive towards correct tools for valuation


Some earn by trading sweat for it, few by being on a winning spree...  
Others in exchange for their services, and the rest by charging a flat fee


How can something made of paper be so authoritative, you might enquire...    
It's not the paper being exchanged, rather it's value, decided by seller and the buyer


Many ask the same question repeatedly; these souls cannot be dismissed outright...  
The formula for valuation of money has been tampered with and they are entitled to fight


‘50% percent of global wealth belongs to 1% of population’, statistic shrieks...  
Hats off if it's all earned by capitalism, if not, foul allege the meeks


History projects simpler times, exchange of items with barter system in place...  
Assigning value to those items was unnerving, resulting arguments lacked all grace


How easy it is when money dictates value, the acceptance began at turn of last century...  
Until man-made monsters like credit crisis surfaced, and the world erupted with fury


I'm not wise enough to advice you, but I sure can pretend it...  
Let me share my 2 cents with you; yes, pun intended


Get a necklace or tickets to Europe, or anything your spouse always secretly yearned...  
Euphoric she will feel, thus you will too, like the wedding vows being reaffirmed


Take your family to maldives; those white-sand beaches, the coral reefs; its like heaven on earth...  
Resulting memories will be cherished till eternity; ignore the bills, memories are completely worth


Don’t tremble about the cost of education, be proud to know that your child dreams of MIT...  
Even without fancy university, a successful entrepreneur one day, she still might be


Whatever you do, assign value to every single penny in your vault...  
Otherwise the heap will keep decaying, eventually won't be worth its salt


Use similar formula to judge people, but not just based on whose wallet is fatter...  
Results vary wildly with empathy and commitment; these characteristics do matter


If God gave us a prism for right behavior about money, it will display a broad spectrum...  
From Larry Page pushing the humanity forward, to an enlightened sage doling out words of wisdom


I go out everyday, to learn, to contribute, to get more skillful and snappy...  
I exchange it for money, but guess which side of the transaction makes me more happy


Once you invest in experiences and not materials, it all becomes clear as day...  
May we realize that money is just one of the values, clear-headed ones always pray


This poem's disconnect from previous ones is weird, even downright funny...    
At worst, it wasted your time, but thank God this blog doesn't charge any money
