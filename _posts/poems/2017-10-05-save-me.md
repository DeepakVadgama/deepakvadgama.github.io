excerpt: Save me.. for my repentance won't age
---

Save me..    
For my repentance won't age    
For my mind won't pledge    
For my sins won't hedge    
For the monkey isn't caged    
    
Save me..    
From the consuming addiction    
From the lack of conviction    
From the flailing volition    
From the laziness within    
    
Save me..    
From this baseless jealousy    
From this material fallacy    
From the needs superfluous    
From the struggle tenuous    
    
Save me..    
From this pinned delusion    
From this grand deception    
From the constant stimuli    
From the inner strife    
    
Save me..    
For it's dark through the day    
For this cruelty won't abate    
For the voice grows meek    
For the foundation is weak    
    
Save me..    
For I beg you Mother    
For it's only you, none other    
For I can't win on my own    
For your gifts aren't adorn    
    
Save me..    
For you are merciful    
For your love is unconditional    
For you've saved plentiful    
For I will be eternal dutiful    
    
Save me
