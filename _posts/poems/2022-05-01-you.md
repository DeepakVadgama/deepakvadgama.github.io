excerpt: first blush, provoked a blank stare  
---

first blush, provoked a blank stare  
the devil grinned, muttered 'beware'  
  
mirage it must, in this world of shadow  
defiant breeze, invigorating meadow  
  
your eyes, they bedim the stars  
your smile, could stop the wars  
  
your hair, to bewilder a stream  
your voice, to startle a dream  
  
your grace, to seduce the red  
your physique, to rouse the dead  
  
description, inconceivable verbal  
an angel, ageless immortal  
  
any resistance, futile and fraught  
against manifestation of 'smoking hot'  
  
even your wraith, quelled the thirst  
it rose again, your aura, the lust  
  
provocative, such charge and fire  
a queen, impervious to extrinsic desire  
  
oblivious to own power, fluttering unaware  
sole hope for meeks, elude the spell, go dare  
  
urge to overpower, to touch and kiss  
angst of sullying, your soft pink lips  
  
brush of my fingers, across your waist  
I pull you closer, getting a taste  
  
the hold and kiss, ascension and zest  
the charge electric, does not accord protest  
  
unruly the tension, possessed, I accede  
fire engulfs, then you concede  
  
the struggle retracts, your lips part  
you loosen the grip, bodies no longer apart  
  
pleading 'yes', you accept defeat  
intertwined, start & end, no longer discrete  
  
rhythmic movement, I hear your moan  
let alone mortals, it would stir a stone  
  
euphoric the end, broken with a smile  
moment of ecstasy, devoid of guile  
  
nectar of Gods, girl of dreams  
it'd force a slob, become man of means  
  
blinded by self, misgave premonition  
I'm now a fanatic, you my addiction  
  
nobody knows you like I do, thank the lord  
It'd cause an uproar, battle of the gods  
  
  
epilogue:  
your presence, triggers dilation  
your proximity, spurs exhilaration  
your touch, reveals liberation  
your absence, breeds sedation
