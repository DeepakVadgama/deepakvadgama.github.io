Relationships are the silk strands connecting souls like me and you...   
I don't understand them fully, but let me point similarities between the two


Insubstantial they look to the naked eye, so evident is their fragility...   
Like heartbeats and breaths, taken for granted is their vitality 


They come in many forms, each being subtly different...   
Smooth and shiny they feel, until we face the ones affront 


While young and curious, we are built a prison of silk; equal parts isolated and bare...   
Parents ignore your pleads to break out; oblivious they are to the wilderness out there 


At tender age when a princess connects, heart dreams for lifespan right then and there...  
When silk is tugged too hard too soon, it breaks apart, and I think that's only fair 


The fall is hard if leaning on the strand; thousand complains of pain and of life being unfair...   
Getting up takes a while; but the lesson is learned in importance of patience and care


Over the years, the strands reach out to hundreds, seeding new friends all around...   
They together form the safety net, making it your inner child's playground  


Time takes its toll on the strands though, few wither away every other year...   
Each one is cherished for a while; remaining ones, forever you hold them dear


You team up with your queen by tying the knot, like rock climbers on a cliff sharing a rope...   
That strand is stronger than steel yet lighter than feather, even the mightiest obstacles fail to cope


The day comes when you create a cocoon to protect your child...   
Because you've seen the world out there, nothing about it is mild 


One strand holds still, omnipresent in death, the middle and even in birth...   
Visible only through lenses of faith, it stretches from the heaven to the earth 


Astronauts know how small we are in scheme of things; how petty are our differences and fights...   
The world is a mesh of billions of connections; each twinkle, as it transfers pulses of lights 


Keep spinning them; more connections are better than just a few...   
A spider never runs out of silk and with God's grace neither will you
