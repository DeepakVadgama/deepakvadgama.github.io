excerpt: Trail of blood, dripping down
---

Trail of blood, dripping down  
Sweat, dust and the frown  
Fellows being gunned down  
Us soldiers, move on and on  

The brown of the chaos  
Intense, unfair pathos   
In the name of honor, paying costs  
Brothers in arms, in a just cause  

Seemingly no end in sight  
In the fire of the night  
Sharing stories of life  
Shared pain, no strife  

A ray of hope, waiting to ignite  
Apparent with progress in sight  
In eventual slope of alight  
Or, onwards in the journey of the fight
