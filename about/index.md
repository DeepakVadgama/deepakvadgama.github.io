Hey there.. 

I am primarily a Java developer with 10 years of experience, having worked with HSBC, JPMorgan and Nomura. 

Since Oct-2015, I've been working as a freelancer/consultant. 
In that capacity, I have created a Wordpress [website](https://balajiextrusions.com), consulting a [company](https://balajiextrusions.com) on it's ERP software, and working on 2 other projects. 
I have experience working with Spring, AngularJS and have completed [Udacity Android Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801) course. [My resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LgFWkJshx94o0DCmTvFmd_dlUNva9Vc4W7PAchhh3q4/edit?usp=sharing) (as of Sep-2016).  

I have worked as tech lead in a 4 person *failed* start-up [chat2get.com]({{ site.url }}/projects/perils-of-startup). 

I like to keep abreast with technology news, and I'm passionate about photography. I am also a fan of Roger Federer, Heath Ledger and Google.

I intend to blog about following topics: Technology, Programming, Photography, Poems and occasional ramblings.

Thanks for stopping by...
