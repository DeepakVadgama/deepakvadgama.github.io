Hey there

I am primarily a Java developer with 11 years of experience, having worked with HSBC, J.P.Morgan and Nomura for ~10 years. 
 I also worked as tech lead in a 4 person *failed* start-up [chat2get.com]({{ site.url }}/projects/perils-of-startup) for span of 10 months. 

From October-2015 until March-2017, I was CTO and co-founder of services company 'Mindfort Tech'. During this time, I primarily worked with cable/wire manufacturing company called [Balaji Wires](https://balajiwires.in). As a sole developer, I created their [website](https://balajiwires.in) based on wordpress, and enhanced their [ERP software]({{ site.url }}/projects/refactoring-to-sanity/).

Details of most of my projects can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/projects/). 
 
I have experience working with Spring Boot, AngularJS, Google Cloud and have [Udacity Android Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801). [My resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LgFWkJshx94o0DCmTvFmd_dlUNva9Vc4W7PAchhh3q4/edit?usp=sharing) (as of August-2017).  

I like to keep abreast with technology news. I am also a fan of Roger Federer, Heath Ledger and Google.

Thanks for stopping by..
