Hey there

I am primarily a Java developer with 10.5 years of experience, having worked with HSBC, JPMorgan and Nomura for 9 years. 
 I also worked as tech lead in a 4 person *failed* start-up [chat2get.com]({{ site.url }}/projects/perils-of-startup) for span of 10 months. 

Since Oct-2015, I've been working as a freelancer/consultant. 
In that capacity, I have created a Wordpress [website](https://balajiextrusions.com), consulted a [cable manufacturing company](https://balajiextrusions.com) on it's ERP software, and currently working on 2 other projects. List of all
 my projects can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/projects/). 
 
I have experience working with Spring Boot, AngularJS and have completed [Udacity Android Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801) course. [My resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LgFWkJshx94o0DCmTvFmd_dlUNva9Vc4W7PAchhh3q4/edit?usp=sharing) (as of Dec-2016).  

I like to keep abreast with technology news, and I'm passionate about photography. I am also a fan of Roger Federer, Heath Ledger and Google.
