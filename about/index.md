Hey there.. 

I am primarily a Java developer with 9 years of experience, having worked with HSBC, JPMorgan and Nomura. 

Since Oct-2015, I've been working as a freelancer/consultant. 
In that capacity, I have created a Wordpress [website](https://balajiextrusions.com), consulting a [company](https://balajiextrusions.com) on it's ERP software, and working on 2 other projects. 
I have experience working with Spring, AngularJS and have completed [Udacity Android Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801) course. [My resume]({{ site.url }}/downloads/Deepak_Vadgama_Resume.pdf) (as of Aug-2016).  

I have worked as tech lead in a 4 person *failed* start-up [chat2get.com](http://www.chat2get.com) (which also powers [doctive.de](http://doctive.de)). 

I like to keep abreast with techonology news, and am passionate about photography. I am also a fan of Roger Federer, Heath Ledger and Google.

In this blog, I intend to write about following topics: Technology, Programming, Photography, Poems and occasional ramblings.

Thanks for stopping by...
