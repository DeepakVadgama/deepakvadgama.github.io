Hi there

I am an avid photographer and a progammer. I have close to 9 years of experience (Java) working with HSBC, JPMorgan and Nomura. 

I have worked as tech lead in a 4 person start-up [chat2get.com](http://www.chat2get.com) (which also powers [doctive.de](http://doctive.de)). I am currently working on a start-up as a founder (very early stage).. more details to come soon.

Btw, I am a huge fan of Heath Ledger, Roger Federer and Google.

I will focus on writing on following topics: Technology, Programming (Tools, Java, Performance), Photography and occasionally poems and ramblings.

Thanks for stopping by...
