Hey there

My name is Deepak. I work as an Engineering Manager with Google. I have 18+ years of experience in the industry. I used to work as an IC (Java) for ~12 years, having worked with HSBC, J.P.Morgan and Nomura for ~10 years. After that, I tried my hand at startups twice. Once as a product company ([chat2get.com]({{ site.url }}/projects/perils-of-startup)) which did not pan out and then as a services / consultancy for 2 years which was a great [learning experience]({{ site.url }}/projects/refactoring-to-sanity/). I led GoFood's Consumer Growth and Merchant Growth teams as a Senior Engineering Manager for 2 years. Since 2021, I am working with Google on an API Platform team. My [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m_-v73UO_ZoqZLQEs1imxBfTtVEOMi-_/view?usp=sharing) as of January, 2024

I like reading books (mostly SciFi), listening to music and watching TV shows. I also like watching [Starcraft 2 gameplays](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN6CQ4Ggaf4vggezip17n9czKMjj8cyRt). In my past life, I used to [write poems]({{ site.url }}/poems), [do photography]({{ site.url }}/photography) and [create videos](https://youtube.com/@defogtech) on YouTube. 

Please feel free to reach out to me on [email](mailto:mail@deepakvadgama.com) or [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/VadgamaDeepak). 

Thanks for stopping by..
